Behold, the heavens and the Heaven of heavens cannot contain You. How much less this house which I have built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O Jehovah my God, and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that Your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, toward the place where You have spoken to put Your name, that You may hear the prayer which Your servant prays toward this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And may You hear the supplications of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. Hear from Heaven Your dwelling place, and when You have heard, forgive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If anyone sins against his neighbor, and has been required to swear an oath, and has come with an oath before Your altar in this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then hear from Heaven, and act, and judge Your servants, to bring retribution on the wicked to bring his way upon his own head, and to justify the righteous to give him according to his righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Or if Your people Israel are struck down before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and have returned and confessed Your name, and prayed and made supplication before You in this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>then hear from Heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You have given to them and their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, when they have prayed toward this place and confessed Your name, and turned from their sin because You afflicted them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>then hear in Heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When there is famine in the land, pestilence or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers; when their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever the plague or whatever the sickness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>whatever prayer or supplication is made by anyone, or by all Your people Israel, when each one knows his own plague and his own grief, and has spread out his hands to this house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>then hear from Heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and give to everyone according to all his ways, whose heart You know (for You alone have known the hearts of the sons of men),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that they may fear You, to walk in Your ways all the days they live on the face of the land which You have given to our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Moreover, concerning a foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel, but who has come from a distant land because of Your great name and Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm, when they have come and prayed in this house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>then hear from Heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, that all peoples of the earth may know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When Your people go out to battle against their enemies, wherever You send them, and when they have prayed to You toward this city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>then hear from Heaven their prayer and their supplication, and do what is fitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When they sin against You (for there is no one who does not sin), and You have become angry with them and delivered them to the enemy, and they have taken them captive to a land far or near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>yet when they have returned in their hearts in the land where they have been carried captive, and have turned back, and sought Your favor in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have acted wickedly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and when they have returned to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been carried captive, and prayed toward their land which You have given to their fathers, the city which You have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Your name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>then hear from Heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplications, and bring about justice, and forgive Your people who have sinned against You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now, my God, I pray, let Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer of this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now therefore, Arise, O Jehovah God, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. Let Your priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let Your saints rejoice in goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>O Jehovah God, do not turn away the face of Your anointed; remember the faithfulness of Your servant David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
