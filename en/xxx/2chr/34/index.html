Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to supervise. Others of the Levites were teaching the instruments of song,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>were over the burden bearers, and were overseers of all who did work in any kind of service. And some of the Levites were scribes, officers, and gatekeepers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of Jehovah given by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the Book of the Law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah gave the Book to Shaphan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Shaphan carried the Book to the king, bringing the king word, saying, All that was committed to your servants they are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they have gathered the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have given it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Shaphan the scribe reported to the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a Book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came about, when the king heard the Words of the Law, that he tore his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Go, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for those who are left in Israel and Judah, concerning the Words of the Book that has been found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that has been poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the Word of Jehovah, to do according to all that is written in this Book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Hilkiah and those from the king went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. (She was living in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter.) And they spoke to her regarding this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And she answered them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Tell the man who has sent you to Me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am bringing evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the Book which they have read before the king of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, to provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus you shall speak to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, whose Words you have heard:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because your heart has been tender, and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His Words against this place and against its inhabitants, and you humbled yourself before Me, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I also have heard you, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Behold, I am gathering you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I am bringing upon this place and its inhabitants. So they brought back word to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the priests and the Levites, and all the people, great and small. And he read in their ears all the Words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to do the Words of the covenant that were written in this Book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he caused all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. So the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Josiah removed all the abominations from all the land of the children of Israel, and caused all who were found in Israel to serve, being subject unto Jehovah their God. All his days they did not depart from following Jehovah the God of their fathers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
