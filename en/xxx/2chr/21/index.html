And Jehoram his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Their father gave them many gifts of silver and gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now when Jehoram rose to power over the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and killed all his brothers with the sword, and also others of the rulers of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for he had the daughter of Ahab as a wife; and he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In his days the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Jehoram went out with his commanders, and all his chariots with him. And he rose up by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus Edom has been in revolt from under the hand of Judah to this day. At that time Libnah revolted from under his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah the God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotry, and thrust Judah aside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And a writing came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says Jehovah the God of your father David: Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot like the harlotry of the house of Ahab, and also have killed your brothers, those of your fathers household, who were better than yourself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>behold, Jehovah is striking your people with a great blow; your children, your wives, and all your possessions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and you shall have great sickness with a disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out by reason of the sickness, day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they came up into Judah and broke through, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the kings house, and also his sons and his wives, so that there was not a son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And after all this Jehovah struck him in his intestines with an incurable disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it happened in the course of time, after the end of two years, that his intestines came out because of his sickness; so he died from the miserable disease. And his people made no burning for him, like the burnings for his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He was thirty-two years old when he became king. He reigned in Jerusalem eight years and, and departed unloved. And they buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
