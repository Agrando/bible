And he answered him, I am as you are, and my people as your people; also with you in the war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire for the Word of Jehovah today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain? And they said, Go up, for God will deliver it into the kings hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not still a prophet of Jehovah here, that we may inquire of Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is still one man by whom to inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, because he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. He is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the king of Israel summoned one of his officers and said, Bring Micaiah the son of Imla quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, clothed in their robes, were sitting each on his throne; and they were sitting at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made horns of iron for himself; and he said, Thus says Jehovah: With these you shall thrust at the Syrians to finish them off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for Jehovah has delivered it into the kings hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Therefore please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak of good things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Micaiah said, As Jehovah lives, whatever my God says, that I will speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he came to the king; and the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain? And he said, Go and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the king said to him, How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah said, These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Micaiah said, Therefore hear the Word of Jehovah: I have seen Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the host of the heavens standing on His right hand and His left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jehovah said, Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel to go up, that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead? So one spoke in this manner, and another spoke in that manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then a spirit came forward and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will persuade him. Jehovah said to him, In what way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he said, I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, You shall seduce him and also succeed; go out and do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore behold, Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours, and Jehovah has spoken evil against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way has the spirit from Jehovah gone from me to speak to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the kings son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and say, Thus says the king: Put this one in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction until I return in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Micaiah said, If indeed you do return in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, Pay attention, all you people!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now the king of Syria had commanded the commanders of the chariots who were with him, saying, Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So it was, when the commanders of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel! Therefore they surrounded him to engage in battle; but Jehoshaphat cried out, and Jehovah helped him, and God drew them away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For so it was, when the commanders of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand and bring me out of the battle, for I am wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The battle increased that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot in view of the Syrians until evening; and about the time of sunset he died.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
