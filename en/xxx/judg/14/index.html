And Samson said to his father, Get her for me, for she is pleasing to my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But his father and mother did not know that it was of Jehovah, that He was seeking an occasion against the Philistines. For at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion came roaring toward him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon him, and he tore the lion apart as one would have torn apart a young goat, though he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he went down and talked with the woman; and she was pleasing in the eyes of Samson.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>After some days, when he returned to take her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion. And behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the carcass of the lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he took some of it in his hands and went along, eating. And when he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them, and they also ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So his father went down to the woman. And Samson gave a feast there, for young men usually did this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samson said to them, Let me propound a riddle to you. If you expound to declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if you are not able to declare it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing. And they said to him, Propound your riddle, that we may hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to them: Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And for three days they were not able to expound the riddle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But it came to pass on the seventh day that they said to Samsons wife, Entice your husband, that he may expound the riddle to us, or else we will burn you and your fathers house with fire. Have you invited us in order to make us poor? Is that not so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Samsons wife wept before him, and said, You only hate me! You do not love me! You have propounded a riddle to the sons of my people, but you have not explained it to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not expounded it to my father or my mother; so should I declare it to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted. And it happened on the seventh day that he told her, because she pressed him so much. And she declared the riddle to the sons of her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down: What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them: If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck thirty of their men, took their apparel, and gave the changes of clothing to those who had declared the riddle; thus his anger burned. And he went up to his fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Samsons wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
