We will burn your house down on you with fire!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Jephthah said to them, My people and I were in a great struggle with the sons of Ammon; and when I called you, you did not deliver me out of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So when I saw that you would not deliver me, I put my soul into my hands and crossed over against the sons of Ammon; and Jehovah delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Gileadites seized the fords of the Jordan before the Ephraimites arrived. And when any Ephraimite who escaped said, Let me cross over, the men of Gilead would say to him, Are you an Ephraimite? If he said, No,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>then they would say to him, Then say, Shibboleth! And he would say, Sibboleth, for he could not speak it right. Then they would take him and kill him at the fords of the Jordan. There fell at that time forty-two thousand from Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He had thirty sons. And he sent thirty daughters in marriage outside, and brought in thirty daughters from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After him, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel. He judged Israel ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>After him, Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy young donkeys. And he judged Israel eight years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mountains of the Amalekites.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
