So she brought him into her fathers house; and when the father of the young woman saw him, he was glad to meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his father-in-law, the young womans father, detained him; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it came to pass on the fourth day that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart; but the young womans father said to his son-in-law, Sustain your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they sat down, and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the young womans father said to the man, Please accept my invitation to stay the night, and let your heart be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the man rose up to depart, his father-in-law pressed upon him; so he turned back and lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, but the young womans father said, Please sustain your heart. So they delayed until afternoon; and both of them ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when the man rose up to depart, he and his concubine and his servant, his father-in-law, the young womans father, said to him, Behold, the day is now drawing toward evening; please spend the night. Behold, the day is coming to an end; lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow go your way early, so that you may go to your tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>However, the man was not willing to spend that night; so he rose up and departed, and came to a place opposite Jebus (which is, Jerusalem). With him were the two saddled donkeys; his concubine was also with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They were near Jebus, and the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, please, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But his master said to him, We will not turn aside here into a city of foreigners, who are not of the children of Israel; we will go on to Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to his servant, Come, let us draw near to one of these places, and lodge in Gibeah or in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they passed by and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they turned aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah. And when he went in, he sat down in the open place of the city, for no one received them into his house to lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And behold, an old man came in from his work in the field at evening, who also was from the mountains of Ephraim; he was sojourning in Gibeah, whereas the men of the place were Benjamites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he lifted up his eyes, he saw the traveling man in the open place of the city; and the old man said, Where are you going, and where do you come from?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to him, We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah toward the remote areas of the mountains of Ephraim; I am from there. I went to Bethlehem in Judah; now I am going to the house of Jehovah. But no one is receiving me into his house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>even though we have both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for myself, for your handmaid, and for the young man who is with your servant; there is no lack of anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the old man said, Peace to you! However, let all your needs be upon me; only do not spend the night in the open place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he brought him into his house, and gave fodder to the donkeys. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, certain men of the city, sons of wickedness surrounded the house and beat on the door. They spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring out the man who has come to your house, that we may know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, No, my brethren! I beg you, do not act so wickedly! Seeing this man has come into my house, do not do this disgraceful folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine; let me bring them out now. Humble them, and do with them whatever seems good to your eyes; but to this man do not do such a disgraceful thing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the men would not heed him. So the man took his concubine and brought her out to them. And they knew her and abused her wantonly all night until morning; and when the day began to break, they let her go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the woman came as the day was dawning, and fell down at the door of the mans house where her master was, till it was light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when her master arose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way, behold the woman, his concubine, fallen at the door of the house with her hands on the threshold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to her, Get up and let us be going. But there was no answer. So the man lifted her onto the donkey; and the man rose up and went to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he entered his house he took a knife, laid hold of his concubine, and divided her into twelve pieces with her bones, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And so it was that all who saw it said, No such deed has been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day. Determine, take counsel, and speak up!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
