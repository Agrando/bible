And the sons of Israel said, Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, My concubine and I went into Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, to lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house at night because of me. They had thought to kill me, but instead they have humbled my concubine so that she died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So I took hold of my concubine, cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the land of the inheritance of Israel, because they have committed lewdness and disgraceful folly in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, all of you are sons of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the people rose up as one man, saying, None of us shall go to his tent, nor shall any turn away to his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but now this is the thing which we shall do to Gibeah: We shall go up against it by lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We shall take ten men out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to carry provisions for the people, that when they come to Gibeah in Benjamin, they may repay all the disgrace that they have done in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united as one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What is this evil that has been done among you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now therefore, deliver up the men, the sons of wickedness who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove the evil from Israel! But the sons of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren, the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the sons of Benjamin gathered together from their cities to Gibeah, to go to battle against the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And from their cities at that time the sons of Benjamin numbered twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered seven hundred choice men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Among all this people were seven hundred choice men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now besides Benjamin, the men of Israel numbered four hundred thousand men who drew the sword; all of these were men of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sons of Israel arose and went up to the house of God to inquire of God. They said, Which of us shall go up first to battle against the sons of Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Judah first!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the sons of Israel arose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the sons of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and on that day destroyed down to the ground twenty-two thousand men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and again set the battle in array at the place where they had put themselves in array on the first day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the sons of Israel went up and wept before Jehovah until evening, and asked counsel of Jehovah, saying, Shall I again draw near for battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Go up against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the sons of Israel approached the sons of Benjamin on the second day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah on the second day, and destroyed down to the ground eighteen thousand men of the sons of Israel; all these drew the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And all the children of Israel, all the people, went up and came to the house of God and wept. They sat there before Jehovah and fasted that day until evening; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the sons of Israel inquired of Jehovah (the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Israel set men in ambush all around Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in battle array against Gibeah as at the other times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the sons of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city. They began to strike down and kill some of the people, as at the other times, in the highways (one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah) and in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the sons of Benjamin thought, They are struck down before us, as at first. But the sons of Israel had said, Let us flee and draw them away from the city into the highways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So all the men of Israel rose from their place and put themselves in battle array at Baal Tamar. Then IsraelÂ’s men in ambush burst forth from their places in the plain of Geba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And ten thousand choice men from all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle was heavy. But the Benjamites did not know that evil was upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jehovah struck down Benjamin before Israel. And the sons of Israel destroyed that day twenty-five thousand one hundred of Benjamin; all who drew the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were struck down. And the men of Israel had given ground to the Benjamites, because they had trusted on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the men in ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah; the men in ambush drew out and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise up from the city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>whereupon the men of Israel turned around in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty of the men of Israel. For they thought, Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and behold the whole city had gone up in smoke to the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when the men of Israel turned back, the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that evil had come upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness; and the battle overtook them, and whoever came out of the cities they destroyed in their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>They surrounded Benjamin, chased them, and easily trampled them down as far as the front of Gibeah toward the rising sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these were men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon; and they thrust upon five thousand of them on the highways; and pursued them to Gidom, and killed two thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So all who fell of Benjamin that day were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these were men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they remained at the rock of Rimmon for four months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the men of Israel turned back against the sons of Benjamin, and struck them down with the edge of the sword; entire cities, beasts, and all who were found. They also set fire to every city they found.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
