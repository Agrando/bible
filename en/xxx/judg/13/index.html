And no razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the woman came and told her husband, saying, A Man of God has come to me, and His countenance was like the countenance of the Angel of God, very awesome; but I did not ask Him where He was from, and He did not tell me His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And He said to me, Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. Now drink no wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Manoah prayed to Jehovah, and said, O my Lord, please let the Man of God whom You sent come to us again and teach us what we shall do for the boy who is to be born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God heeded the voice of Manoah, and the Angel of God came to the woman again as she was sitting in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the woman ran in haste and told her husband, and said to him, Behold, the Man who came to me the other day has appeared to me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Manoah arose and followed his wife. When he came to the Man, he said to Him, Are You the Man who spoke to the woman? And He said, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Manoah said, Now let Your words come to pass! What are the ordinances for the boy, and what are his works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, Of all that I have said to the woman let her take heed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She shall not eat anything that comes from the vine, nor shall she drink wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean. All that I have commanded her let her take heed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, Please let us detain You, and we will prepare a young goat for You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, Though you detain Me, I will not eat your food. But if you offer a burnt offering, you shall offer it unto Jehovah. (For Manoah did not know He was the Angel of Jehovah.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, What is Your name, that when Your words come to pass we may honor You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Why do you ask after My name, seeing it is incomprehensible?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it upon the rock unto Jehovah. And He did an extraordinary thing while Manoah and his wife were watching;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>it happened as the flame went up toward the heavens from the altar; that the Angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar! And Manoah and his wife were watching this, and they fell on their faces to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Angel of Jehovah appeared no more to Manoah and his wife. Then Manoah knew that He was the Angel of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Manoah said to his wife, We shall die the death, because we have seen God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But his wife said to him, If Jehovah had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have told us such things as these at this time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman bore a son and called his name Samson; and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move upon him at the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
