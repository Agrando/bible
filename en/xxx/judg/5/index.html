Give ear, O princes! I, even I, will sing unto Jehovah; I will make music unto Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jehovah, when You went out from Seir, when You marched from the field of Edom, the earth trembled and the heavens dropped, even the clouds dropped water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>the mountains flowed before Jehovah, this Sinai, before Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were deserted, and the travelers walked along the byways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Village life ceased, it ceased in Israel, until I, Deborah, arose, arose a mother in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They chose new gods; then there was war in the gates; not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>My heart is with the governors of Israel who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless Jehovah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Sing out, you who ride on white donkeys, who sit on carpets, and who walk along the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>At the sound where they divide the flocks among the places to draw water, there they shall recount the righteous acts of Jehovah, the righteous acts to His village dwellers in Israel; then the people of Jehovah shall go down to the gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, and lead your captives captive, O son of Abinoam!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the remnant came down and had dominion over the kings of the nations; for me Jehovah trod down the mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Out of Ephraim were those whose roots were in Amalek. After you, Benjamin, with your peoples, from Machir came down governors, and from Zebulun those who bear the staff of scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the commanders of Issachar were with Deborah; as was Issachar, so was Barak, sent on foot into the valley. Among the divisions of Reuben there were great resolves of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, to hear the pipings for the flocks? At the divisions of Reuben were great searchings of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan, and why did Dan remain on ships? Asher continued at the seashore, and stayed by his landings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Zebulun is a people who jeopardized their souls even to death, Naphtali also, on the heights of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The kings came and fought, then the kings of Canaan fought in Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They fought from the heavens; the stars from their courses fought against Sisera.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The torrent of Kishon swept them away, that ancient torrent, the torrent of Kishon. O my soul, tread on in strength!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the horses hooves pounded, the galloping, galloping of his steeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Curse Meroz, said the Angel of Jehovah, curse its inhabitants bitterly, because they did not come to the help of Jehovah, to the help of Jehovah against the mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Most blessed among women is Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; blessed is she among women in the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He asked for water, she gave milk; she brought out curds in a lordly bowl.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>She stretched her hand to the tent peg, her right hand to the workmans hammer; she has hammered Sisera, she has destroyed his head, she has pierced and struck through his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>At her feet he has bowed down, he has fallen, he has lain down; at her feet he has bowed down, he has fallen; where he has bowed down, there he has fallen destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The mother of Sisera has looked through the window, and cried out through the lattice, Why has his chariot delayed to come? Why have the hoof beats of his chariot waited?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Her wise ladies answered her, Yea, she answers herself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Are they not finding and dividing the spoils: to each chief warrior a girl to love; for Sisera, plunder of dyed garments, plunder of garments embroidered and dyed, two pieces of dyed embroidery for the necks of the plunderers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thus let all Your enemies perish, O Jehovah! But let those who love Him be like the sun when it goes forth in its might. Thus the land was quiet forty years.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
