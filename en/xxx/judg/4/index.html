The commander of his army was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth Hagoyim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and for twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, was judging Israel at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she was dwelling under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. And the children of Israel went up to her for judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And she sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, Has not Jehovah the God of Israel commanded: Go and proceed to Mount Tabor; take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and I will draw out to you Sisera, the commander of Jabins army, with his chariots and his multitude at the River Kishon; and I will deliver him into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she said, I will walk to go with you; nevertheless there will be no glory for you in the journey you are taking, for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; he went up with ten thousand men at his feet, and Deborah went up with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Heber the Kenite, of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the plain at Zaanaim, near Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth Hagoyim to the River Kishon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Deborah said to Barak, Up! For this is the day in which Jehovah has delivered Sisera into your hand. Has not Jehovah gone out before you? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jehovah routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not one was left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>However, Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; do not fear. And when he had turned aside to her into the tent, she covered him with a blanket.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to her, Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. So she opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to her, Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, Is there any man here? you shall say, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jael, Hebers wife, took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went down into the ground; for he was fast asleep and weary. Thus he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, I will show you the man whom you are seeking. And when he went into her tent, behold, Sisera was lying dead with the peg in his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So on that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the hand of the sons of Israel continued and proceeded to grow stronger against Jabin king of Canaan, until they had cut off Jabin king of Canaan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
