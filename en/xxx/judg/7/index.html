And twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people are still too many; bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. And it shall be, that of whom I say to you, This one shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whomever I say to you, This one shall not go with you, the same shall not go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he brought the people down to the water. And Jehovah said to Gideon, Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set apart by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehovah said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped I will deliver you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the other people go, every man to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the people took provisions and their shofars in their hands. And he sent away all the rest of Israel, every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men. Now the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass on the same night that Jehovah said to him, Rise up, go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and you shall hear what they say; and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp. And he went down with Purah his servant to the extremity of the armed men who were in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the Midianites and Amalekites, all the sons of the east, were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the seashore for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when Gideon came, there was a man telling a dream to his companion. He said, I have dreamed a dream: Behold, a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian; it came to a tent and struck it so that it fell and overturned, and the tent lay flat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And his companion answered and said, This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel! Into his hand God has delivered Midian and the whole camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And so it was, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that he bowed down. He returned to the camp of Israel, and said, Arise, for Jehovah has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a shofar into each mans hand, with empty jars, and torches inside the jars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, Look at me and do likewise; and behold, when I come to the edge of the camp you shall do as I do:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I blow the shofar, I and all who are with me, then you also blow the shofars on every side of the whole camp, and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just as they had posted the watch; and they blew the shofars and shattered the jars that were in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the three companies blew the shofars and shattered the jars; they held the torches in their left hands and the shofars in their right hands for blowing; and they cried out, The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And each man stood in his place all around the camp; and the whole army ran and cried out and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when the three hundred blew the shofars, Jehovah set every mans sword against his companion throughout the whole camp; and the army fled to Beth Acacia, toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the men of Israel gathered together from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and chased after the Midianites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the mountains of Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and seize from them the waters as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan. And all the men of Ephraim gathered together and seized the waters as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they captured two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued Midian and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
