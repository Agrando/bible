Behold I have delivered the land into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me to my allotted territory, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I will likewise go with you to your allotted territory. And Simeon went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Judah went up, and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they struck ten thousand men at Bezek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Adoni-Bezek said, Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me. Then they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it; they struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the mountains, in the south, and in the lowlands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron. (Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kirjath Arba.) And they killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir was formerly Kirjath Sepher.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Caleb said, Whoever strikes Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Calebs younger brother, took it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it happened, when she came to him, that she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, What do you wish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said to him, Give me a blessing; since you have given me land in the south, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now the children of the Kenite, Moses father-in-law, had gone up from the City of Palms with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Judah also took Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus Jehovah was with Judah. And they dispossessed the mountains, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the lowland, because they had chariots of iron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said. And he dispossessed from there the three sons of Anak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and Jehovah was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city was formerly Luz.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, Please show us the entrance to the city, and we will deal kindly with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>However, Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its daughter-villages, or Taanach and its daughter-villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its daughter-villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its daughter-villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its daughter-villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass, when Israel had become strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not drive out to dispossess them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Nor did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and were put to tribute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but they dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. And the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were put to tribute under them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the Amorites squeezed the children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; yet when the hand of the house of Joseph became heavy, they were put to tribute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
