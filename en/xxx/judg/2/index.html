But you have not obeyed My voice. Why have you done this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore I also have said, I will not drive them out before you; but they shall be thorns in your side, and their gods shall be a snare to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came about, when the Angel of Jehovah spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voices and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Joshua had dismissed the people, the children of Israel went each to his own inheritance to possess the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who prolonged their days after Joshua, who had seen all the great works of Jehovah which He had done for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died when he was one hundred and ten years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Heres, in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When all that generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who had not known Jehovah nor the work which He had done for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and served the Baals;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; and they went after other gods from among the gods of the people who were all around them, and they bowed down to them; and they provoked Jehovah to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They forsook Jehovah and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of plunderers who plundered them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Wherever they went out, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had said, and as Jehovah had sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Nevertheless, Jehovah raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet they would not heed their judges, but they committed adultery with other gods, and bowed down to them. They turned quickly from the way in which their fathers had walked, to obey the commandments of Jehovah; they did not do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Jehovah raised up judges for them, Jehovah was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for Jehovah was moved to pity before their groaning because of those oppressing and thrusting at them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they would turn back and act more corruptly than their fathers, by going after other gods, to serve them and bow down to them. They have not failed from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel; and He said, Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I have commanded their fathers, and has not obeyed My voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua has left when he died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>so that through them I may test Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah, to walk in it as their fathers have kept it, or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore Jehovah left those nations, without driving them out quickly; nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
