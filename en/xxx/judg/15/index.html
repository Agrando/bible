And he said, Let me go in to my wife, into her room. But her father would not permit him to go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Her father said, I thought in my heart that you hated her like an enemy; therefore I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister better than she? Please, take her instead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Samson said to them, This time I shall be blameless regarding the Philistines when I am doing evil to them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes; and he took torches, turned tail to tail, and put a torch between the two tails.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When he had set the torches on fire, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion. So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Samson said to them, Since you did a thing like this, I shall avenge myself on you, and after that I will cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and were spread out at Lehi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the men of Judah said, Why have you come up against us? So they answered, We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? What is this you have done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so I have done to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But they said to him, We have come down to bind you, to deliver you into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they spoke to him, saying, No, but we will tie to bind you and deliver you into their hand; but we will not put you to death. And they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting against him. And the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon him; and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds melted from his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and struck a thousand men with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Samson said: With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey I have slain a thousand men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And so it was, when he had finished speaking, that he threw the jawbone from his hand, and called that place Ramath Lehi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he became very thirsty; so he cried out to Jehovah and said, You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant; and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out, and he drank; and his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore he called its name En Hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
