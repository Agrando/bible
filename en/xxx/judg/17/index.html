And his mother said, Blessed of Jehovah are you, my son!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So when he had returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly consecrated the silver from my hand unto Jehovah for my son, to make a graven image, and a molten image; now therefore, I will return it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thus he returned the silver to his mother. Then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the silversmith, and he made it into a graven image, and a molten image; and they were in the house of Micah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod and household idols; and he confirmed the hand of one of his sons, who became his priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah; he was a Levite, and sojourned there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the man departed from the city of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn wherever he could find a place. And he came to the mountains of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he made his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Micah said to him, Where do you come from? And he said to him, I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn wherever I may find.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten shekels of silver per year, a suit of clothes, and your sustenance. So the Levite went in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man became like one of his sons to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Micah confirmed the hand of the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Micah said, Now I know that Jehovah will be good to me, since I have a Levite as priest!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
