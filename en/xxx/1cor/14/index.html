For you will be speaking into the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There are, it may be, so many ethnic languages in the world, and none of them is without its own speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, if I do not know the dynamics of the language, I shall be a foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks will be a foreigner to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Even so you, since you are zealous for spiritual matters, seek to excel in the building up of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Otherwise, if you praise in the spirit, how will he who occupies the place set apart for the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not built up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank my God I speak with tongues more than every one of you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brethren, do not be children in understanding; however, in malice be infants, but in understanding be mature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the Law it is written: With men of other languages and other lips I will speak to this people; And yet, for all that, they will not hear Me, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore if the whole church comes together in one place, and everyone speaks in tongues, and there come in those who are unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that you are not in your right minds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if everyone prophesies, and an unbeliever or an unlearned person comes in, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And thus the secrets of his heart become revealed; and so, falling down on his face, he will do homage to God and proclaim that God is truly among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How is it then, brethren? Whenever you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at the most three, each in turn, and let one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others discern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if anything is revealed to another who sits by, let the first keep silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you can each prophesy one by one, that everyone may learn and everyone may be encouraged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they are to be in subjection, as the Law also says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if they desire to learn something, let them question their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Or did the Word of God go forth from you? Or did it come only to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Let all things be done decently and in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
