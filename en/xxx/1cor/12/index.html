If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He intended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if they were all one member, where would the body be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now indeed there are many members, but yet one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, we clothe them with greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have abundant elegance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but our presentable parts have no need. But God composed the body, having given more abundant honor to that part which is lacking,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, governings, tongues of nationalities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Not everyone is an apostle are they? Not everyone is a prophet? Not everyone is a teacher? Not everyone is a worker of power?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Not everyone has gifts of healing? Not everyone speaks with tongues? Not everyone interprets?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But earnestly desire the more useful gifts. And yet I show you a way according to excellence.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
