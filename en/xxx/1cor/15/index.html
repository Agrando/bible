But when He says everything is subjected, it is evident that He who subjected everything under Him is exempt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now when everything is subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to Him who subjected everything under Him, that God may be everything in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Otherwise, what will they do who are immersed for the dead, if the dead are not truly raised? Why then are they immersed for the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And why are we in danger every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I affirm, by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die throughout the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If like other men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what profit is it to me, if the dead are not raised? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Do not be led astray: Evil company corrupts good character.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak to your shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But someone will say, How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Foolish one, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And what you sow, you do not sow the body that shall be, but mere grain; perhaps wheat or something else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But God gives it a body as He purposed, and to each seed its own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Not every flesh is the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; but the brightness of the heavenly is one, and the brightness of the earthly is another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is one brightness of the sun, another brightness of the moon, and another brightness of the stars; for one star differs from another star in brightness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And so it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a life-giving Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man was out of the earth, of dust; the second Man is the Lord out of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As is the man of dust, so also are those of dust; and as is the Man from Heaven, so also are those of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the Man of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this corruptible needs to put on incorruption, and this mortal needs to put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
