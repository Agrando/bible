Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you immersed into the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I thank God that I immersed none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that no one should say that I had immersed into my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yes, I also immersed the household of Stephanas. Besides that, I do not know whether I immersed any others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ did not send me to immerse, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the intelligent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who are believing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we preach Christ crucified, truly to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you see your calling, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many of nobility.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are mighty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the low-born of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that no flesh should boast in His presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But out of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who was made for us from God wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that, as it is written, He who exults, let him exult in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
