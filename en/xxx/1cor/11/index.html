But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For a man indeed ought not to veil his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nor was man created through the woman, but woman through the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this reason the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nevertheless, neither is man without the woman, nor woman without the man, in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as woman is out of man, even so man also comes through woman; but all things are from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Judge among yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head unveiled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her in place of a wrap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the churches of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now in this that I command you, I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For first of all, I hear that when you come together as a church there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For there need to also be heresies among you, that those who are approved may be recognized among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lords Supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of others; and one is hungry and another is drunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What? Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, Take, eat; this is My body which is broken on behalf of you; do this in remembrance of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the New Covenant in My blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as you may eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lords death until He comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not making a distinction regarding the Lords body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many have been put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if we would discern ourselves, we would not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
