Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For even if there are so-called gods, whether in the heavens or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>However, there is not in everyone that knowledge; for some, with consciousness of the idol, until now eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat do we excel, nor if we do not eat are we lacking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idolÂ’s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat things offered to idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And because of your knowledge the weak brother will perish, the one for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when you sin in this way against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat flesh, so that I not make my brother stumble.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
