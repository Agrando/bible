And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do not deprive one another except by agreement for a time, that you may be free for fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I say this by permission, not by commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For I wish that all men were even as myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now to the married I command, yet not I but the Lord: A wife is not to leave her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But, indeed, in case she does leave, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to send away his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But to the rest I say, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is willing to live with him, let him not send her away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, if he is willing to live with her, let her not leave him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the unbeliever leaves, let them leave; a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases. But God has called us in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I command in all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Were you called while a slave? Do not be concerned about it; but if you are able to be made free, rather use it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For he who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lords freedman. Likewise he who is called while free is Christs slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Brethren, let each one remain with God however he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now concerning virgins: I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give judgment as one who, having received mercy from the Lord, is faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I suppose therefore that this is good because of the present necessity; that it is good for a man to be thus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But also if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh, but I am sparing you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But this I say, brethren, the time has been shortened, so that even those who have wives should be as though they had none,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and those who use this world as not using it up. For the form of this world is passing away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I want you to be free from anxiety. He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord; how to please the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he who is married cares about the things of the world; how to please his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world; how to please her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of youth, and it is the duty, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin; let him marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has control over his own will, and has so determined in his heart that he will keep himself a virgin, does well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So then he who gives in marriage does well, but he who does not give in marriage does better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A wife is bound by Law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But she is happier if she remains so, according to my judgment; and I think I also have the Spirit of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
