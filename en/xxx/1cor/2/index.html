For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These things we also speak, not in words which human wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he is not able to know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he who is spiritual discerns all things, yet he himself is discerned by no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
