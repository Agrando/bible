In fact, I do not even judge myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For I know nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each oneÂ’s praise will be from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us not to think beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up one over the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For who makes you differ from another? And what do you have that you did not receive? Now if you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You are already full. You are already rich. You have reigned as kings without us; and indeed I wish you truly did reign, that we also might reign with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last, as men condemned to death; for we became spectacles to all creation, both to angels and to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We are foolish because of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are distinguished, but we are dishonored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and we are poorly clothed, and beaten, and wander homeless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>being defamed, we entreat. We have become as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I admonish you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For though you might have countless instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore I urge you, be imitators of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
