And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you not know that we shall judge angels? To say nothing of things that pertain to this life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If then you have judgments concerning things pertaining to this life, you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise person among you, not even one, who will be able to judge between his brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But brother goes to court against brother, and that before unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore, it is already an utter failure with you that you go to court against one another. Why do you not rather accept wrong? Why do you not rather be defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>No, you yourselves do wrong and defraud, and these things to brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be led astray. Neither prostitutes, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be enslaved under the power of any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for sexual perversion but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And God both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up through His power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot? Let it not be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body? For the two, He says, shall become one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee sexual perversion. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are GodÂ’s.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
