For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For when one says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not carnal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believe, as the Lord gave to each one?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I planted, Apollos watered, but God made it grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who causes growth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are Gods fellow workers; you are Gods field, Gods building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For no one is able to lay any other foundation than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>each ones work will be revealed; for the Day will declare it, because it will be disclosed by fire; and the fire will test each ones work, of what sort it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If anyones work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If anyones work is consumed, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become foolish that he may become wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He catches the wise in their own craftiness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come; all are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you are Christs, and Christ is Gods.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
