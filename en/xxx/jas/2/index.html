Do not the rich oppress you and drag you to the judgment seats?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do they not blaspheme that noble name by which you are called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if you fulfill the royal Law according to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the Law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment will be without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Indeed, mercy rejoices over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Is faith able to save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you says to them, Depart in peace, be warmed and filled, but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus also faith, if it does not have works, being alone, is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith from my works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe that God is One. You do well. Even the demons believe, and shudder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But are you willing to understand, O vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father justified from works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do you see how faith was working together with his works, and from works faith was made complete?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. And he was called, Friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You see then that a man is justified from works, and not by faith only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified from works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
