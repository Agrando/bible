Thus the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let no one say when he is tempted, I am tempted by God; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lusts and enticed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then, when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not be led astray, my beloved brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of Lights, with whom there is no change or shadow of turning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of His own purpose He brought us forth by the Word of Truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for the wrath of man does not bring about the righteousness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted Word, which has the power to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But be doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For if anyone is a hearer of the Word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets of what sort he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in his deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but beguiles his own heart, this oneÂ’s religion is vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
