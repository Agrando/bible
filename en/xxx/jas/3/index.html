If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a flawless man, able also to bridle the whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, we put bits in horsesÂ’ mouths that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold also the ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the helmsman desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things. Behold, how large a forest a little fire kindles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. Thus the tongue is set among our members, defiling the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by Gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every kind of beast and bird, and of creeping thing and creature of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But no man is able to tame the tongue. It is an uncontrollable evil, full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the image of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, it is not fitting that these things be this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does a spring send forth fresh water and bitter from the same opening?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show his works out of good conduct, in the meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you have bitter envy and contention in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom does not come down from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where envy and contention exist, there is confusion and every evil deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, fair, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moreover the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
