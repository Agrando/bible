Do they not come from your lusts that war in your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You lust and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war. Yet you do not have because you do not ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Adulterers and adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore purposes to be a friend of the world is shown to be opposing God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, The Spirit who dwells in us yearns to envy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Lament and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will exalt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the Law and judges the Law. But if you judge the Law, you are not a doer of the Law, but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is one Lawgiver, who has the power to save and to destroy. Who are you to judge another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Come now, you who say, Today or tomorrow we will go to this city, spend a year there, do business, and make a profit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>whereas you do not know what will be tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Instead you ought to say, If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now you boast in your presumptions. All such boasting is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
