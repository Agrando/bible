You have heaped up treasure in the last days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Indeed the wages of the laborers who reaped your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury; you have fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have condemned, you have murdered the just; he does not resist you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You also be patient. Make your hearts firm, for the coming of the Lord draws near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not grumble against one another, brethren, that you not be condemned. Behold, the Judge stands at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My brethren, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of suffering affliction and endurance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Indeed we count them blessed who endure. You have heard of the endurance of Job and seen the outcome brought about by the Lord; that the Lord is very kind and merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But above all things, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath. But let your Yes, be Yes, and your No, No, so that you do not fall under condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is anyone among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he may have committed sins, they will be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man is mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Elijah was a man with feelings like ours, and he prayed to God that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth sprouted its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Brethren, if anyone among you goes astray from the truth, and someone turns him back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and conceal a multitude of sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
