Then the priest shall examine him, and pronounce him unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if the bright spot is white on the skin of his flesh, and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and its hair has not turned white, then the priest shall shut up the one who has the sore seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day; and behold, if the sore appears to be as it was, and the sore has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall shut him up another seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day; and behold, if the sore has faded, and the sore has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only a scab, and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if the scab should at all spread over the skin, after he has been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen by the priest again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if the priest sees that, behold, the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the leprous sore is on a person, then he shall be brought to the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the priest shall examine him; and behold, if the swelling on the skin is white, and it has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>it is an old leprosy on the skin of his flesh. The priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if leprosy breaks out all over the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of the one who has the sore, from his head to his foot, whatever is seen by the priestÂ’s eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>then the priest shall consider; and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce the sore clean. It has all turned white. He is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But in the day raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean; for the raw flesh is unclean. It is leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or if the raw flesh returns and has changed to white again, he shall come to the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the priest shall examine him; and behold, if the sore has returned to white, then the priest shall pronounce the sore clean. He is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the flesh has a boil in the skin, and it is healed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and in place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be seen by the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and if, when the priest sees it, behold, it appears deeper than the skin, and its hair has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous sore which has broken out of the boil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if the priest examines it, and behold, there are no white hairs in it, and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall shut him up seven days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and if it should spread abroad over the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if the bright spot stays in one place, and has not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Or if the skin of the flesh is burned by fire, and the raw flesh of the burn develops a bright spot, reddish-white or white,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>then the priest shall examine it; and behold, if the hair of the bright spot has turned white, and it appears deeper than the skin, it is leprosy broken out in the burn. Therefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if the priest examines it, and behold, there are no white hairs in the bright spot, and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day. If it has spread abroad over the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if the bright spot stays in one place, and has not spread on the skin, but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn. The priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the scar from the burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If a man or woman has a sore on the head or in the beard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>then the priest shall examine the sore; and indeed if it appears deeper than the skin, and there is in it thin yellow hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a scaly leprosy of the head or beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if the priest examines the scaly sore, and behold, it does not appear deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up the one who has the scall seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And on the seventh day the priest shall examine the sore; and behold, if the scall has not spread, and there is no yellow hair in it, and the scall does not appear deeper than the skin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>he shall shave himself, but the scall he shall not shave. And the priest shall shut up the one who has the scall another seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>On the seventh day the priest shall examine the scall; and behold, if the scall has not spread over the skin, and does not appear deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. He shall wash his clothes and be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But if the scall should spread abroad over the skin after his cleansing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>then the priest shall examine him; and behold, if the scall has spread over the skin, the priest shall not look for yellow hair. He is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But if the scall appears to have come to a standstill, and black hair has grown up in it, the scall has healed. He is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the flesh, white bright spots,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>then the priest shall look; and behold, if the bright spots on the skin of the flesh are dull white, it is a skin spot that grows on the skin. He is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As for the man whose hair has fallen from his head, he is bald, but he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He whose hair has fallen from his forehead, he is bald on the forehead, but he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And if there is on the bald head or bald forehead a reddish-white sore, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the priest shall examine it; and behold, if the swelling of the sore is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy on the skin of the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>he is a leprous man. He is unclean. The priest shall pronounce to declare him unclean; his plague is on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the leper on whom the plague is, his clothes shall be torn and his head bared; and he shall cover his mustache, and call out, Unclean! Unclean!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He shall be unclean. All the days he has the plague he shall be unclean. He is unclean, and he shall dwell alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if a garment has a leprous spot in it, whether it is a woolen garment or a linen garment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>whether it is in the warp or woof of linen or wool, whether in leather or in anything made of leather,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and if the spot is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather, it is a leprous spot and shall be shown to the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>The priest shall examine the spot and shut up that which has the spot seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he shall examine the spot on the seventh day. If the spot has spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, in the leather or in anything made of leather, the spot is an active leprosy. It is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He shall therefore burn that garment in which is the plague, whether warp or woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of leather, for it is an active leprosy; it shall be burned in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And if the priest examines it, and behold, the spot has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which is the spot; and he shall shut it up another seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the priest shall examine the spot after it has been washed; and indeed if the spot has not changed its color, though the spot has not spread, it is unclean, and you shall burn it in the fire; it continues eating away, whether the damage is outside or inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>If the priest examines it, and behold, the spot has faded after washing it, then he shall tear it out of the garment, whether out of the warp or out of the woof, or out of the leather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather, it is a spreading plague; you shall burn with fire that in which is the plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And if you wash the garment, either warp or woof, or whatever is made of leather, if the spot has gone from it, then it shall be washed a second time, and shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>This is the law of the leprous plague in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp or woof, or in anything made of leather, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
