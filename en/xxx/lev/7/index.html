And its blood shall be sprinkled all around on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he shall offer from it all its fat. The fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and the priest shall burn them on the altar with smoke as an offering by fire unto Jehovah. It is a trespass offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Every male among the priests shall eat of it. It shall be eaten in the holy place. It is set apart, holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The trespass offering is like the sin offering; there is one law for them both: it is for the priest who makes atonement with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the priest who offers anyoneÂ’s burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also every grain offering that is baked in the oven and all that is prepared in the sauce pan, or in a pan, shall be for the priest who offers it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Every grain offering, whether mixed with oil, or dry, shall be for all the sons of Aaron, for one as for the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which he shall offer unto Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer, with the sacrifice of thanksgiving, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers anointed with oil, or cakes of fine flour mixed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Besides the cakes, as his offering he shall offer leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And from it he shall offer one cake from each offering as a heave offering unto Jehovah. It shall be for the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day it is offered. He shall not leave any of it until morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice; and on the next day the remainder of it may also be eaten;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, nor shall it be imputed to him; it shall be an abomination unto him who offers it, and the soul who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned with fire. And as for the other flesh, all who are clean shall eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the soul who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace offering that belongs to Jehovah, while he is unclean, that soul shall be cut off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Moreover the soul who touches any unclean thing, such as human uncleanness, an unclean animal, or any abominable unclean thing, and who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace offering that belongs to Jehovah, that soul shall be cut off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Speak to the children of Israel, saying: You shall not eat any fat, of ox or sheep or goat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the fat of an animal that dies naturally, and the fat of what is torn by wild beasts, may be used for any work; but you shall not eat to devour it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whoever eats the fat of the animal of which men offer an offering by fire unto Jehovah, the soul who eats it shall be cut off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover you shall not eat any blood in any of your dwellings, whether of bird or beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whoever eats any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Speak to the children of Israel, saying: He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offering unto Jehovah shall bring his offering unto Jehovah from the sacrifice of his peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>His own hands shall bring the offerings by fire unto Jehovah. The fat with the breast he shall bring, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the priest shall burn the fat on the altar with smoke, but the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Also the right thigh you shall give to the priest as a heave offering from the sacrifices of your peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He among the sons of Aaron, who offers the blood of the peace offering and the fat, shall have the right thigh for his portion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering I have taken from the children of Israel, from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, from the children of Israel, as a perpetual statute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>This is the portion for the anointing of Aaron and the anointing of his sons, from the offerings by fire unto Jehovah, on the day he presented them to serve Jehovah as priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jehovah commanded this to be given to them by the children of Israel, on the day that he anointed them, as a perpetual statute throughout their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, the consecrations, and the sacrifice of the peace offerings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>which Jehovah had commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day when He commanded the children of Israel to offer their offerings unto Jehovah in the Wilderness of Sinai.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
