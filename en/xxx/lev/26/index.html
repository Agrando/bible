And you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will set My face against you, and you shall be smitten by your enemies. Those who hate you shall reign over you, and you shall flee when no one pursues you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And after all this, if you do not obey Me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will break the pride of your power; I will make your heavens like iron and your earth like bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its produce, nor shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if you walk contrary to Me, and are not willing to obey Me, I will bring upon you seven times more plagues, according to your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and make you few in number; and your highways shall be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if by these things you do not let yourselves be corrected by Me, but walk contrary to Me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then I also will walk contrary to you, and I will punish you yet seven times for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will bring a sword against you that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; when you are gathered together within your cities I will send pestilence among you; and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when I have cut off your supply of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall bring back your bread by weight, and you shall eat and not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after all this, if you do not obey Me, but walk contrary to Me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then I also will walk contrary to you in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And you shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols; and My soul shall abhor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will lay your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell your soothing aromas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I will bring the land to desolation, and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I will scatter you among the nations and draw out a sword after you; your land shall be desolate and your cities waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the land shall enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in the land of your enemies; then the land shall rest and enjoy its sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As long as it lies desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest on your sabbaths when you dwelt in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as for those of you who are left, I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a driven leaf shall cause them to flee; they shall flee as though fleeing from a sword, and they shall fall when no one is pursuing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They shall stumble over one another, as it were before a sword, when no one is pursuing; and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>You shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall consume you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those of you who are left shall rot away in their iniquity in the lands of their enemies; also in their fathersÂ’ iniquities, which are with them, they shall rot away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, with their unfaithfulness in which they were unfaithful to Me, and that they also have walked contrary to Me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and that I also have walked contrary to them and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if their uncircumcised hearts are humbled, and they accept their guilt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with Abraham I will remember; and I will remember the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The land also shall be forsaken by them, and shall be satisfied with its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them; they shall accept their guilt, because they had despised My judgments and because their soul had abhorred My statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor shall I abhor them, to utterly destroy them and break My covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But for their sake I will remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the eyes of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These are the statutes and judgments and laws which Jehovah has set between Himself and the children of Israel on Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
