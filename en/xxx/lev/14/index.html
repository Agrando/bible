After that he shall come into the camp, and shall remain outside his tent seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And on the seventh day he shall shave all the hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows; all his hair he shall shave off. He shall wash his clothes and wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs that are whole, one ewe lamb of the first year that is whole, three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and one log of oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the priest who pronounces him clean shall present the man who is being cleansed, and those things, before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the priest shall take one male lamb and offer it as a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he shall kill the lamb in the place where he kills the sin offering and the burnt offering, in a holy place; for as the sin offering is the priest s, so is the trespass offering.

It is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he shall break down the house, its stones, its timber, and all the plaster of the house, and he shall carry them outside the city to an unclean place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Moreover he who goes into the house at all while it is shut up shall be unclean until evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes, and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And if the priest comes in and examines it, and behold, the plague has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he shall take, to cleanse the house, two birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he shall kill one of the birds on an earthen vessel over running water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and he shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and the running water and the living bird, with the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he shall let the living bird loose outside the city in the open field, and make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This is the law for any leprous plague and scall,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>for the leprosy of a garment and of a house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>for a swelling and a scab and a bright spot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>to teach when it is unclean and when it is clean.
