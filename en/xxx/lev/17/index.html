He has shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>so that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the open field, that they may bring them unto Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, to the priest, and offer them as peace offerings unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat with smoke for a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They shall no more offer their sacrifices to goats, after whom they have played the harlot. This shall be a perpetual statute for them throughout their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also you shall say to them: Any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and does not bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it unto Jehovah, that man shall be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that soul who eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the soul of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I have said to the children of Israel, No one among you shall eat blood, nor shall any stranger who sojourns among you eat blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Any man of the sons of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who hunts and catches any animal or flying creature that may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for it is the soul of all flesh. Its blood is its soul. Therefore I said to the children of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any flesh, for the soul of all flesh is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And every soul who eats what died naturally or what was torn by beasts, whether he is a native or a sojourner, he shall both wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. Then he shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he does not wash them nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
