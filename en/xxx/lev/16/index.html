These are holy garments. Therefore he shall wash his flesh in water, and put them on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he shall take from the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats as a sin offering, and one ram as a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Aaron shall bring near the bull as a sin offering for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He shall take the two goats and present them before Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats: one lot for Jehovah and one lot for the scapegoat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the lot of Jehovah fell, and offer it as a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat shall be presented alive before Jehovah, to make atonement with it, and to let it go as the scapegoat into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Aaron shall bring the bull of the sin offering which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house, and shall kill the bull as the sin offering for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from the altar before Jehovah, with his hands full of spiced incense beaten fine, and bring it inside the veil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he shall put the incense on the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the Testimony, that he not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east side; and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he shall kill the goat of the sin offering for the people, bring its blood inside the veil, do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat and before the mercy seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus he shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, for all their sins; and thus he shall do for the tent of meeting which remains among them in the midst of their uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And no man shall be in the tent of meeting when he goes in to make atonement in the Holy Place, until he comes out.
