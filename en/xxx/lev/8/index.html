And the congregation was gathered together at the door of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Moses said to the congregation, This is what Jehovah has commanded to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he put the tunic on him, girded him with the sash, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him; and he girded him with the intricately woven band of the ephod, and with it tied the ephod on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he put the breastplate on him, and he put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he put the turban on his head. Also on the turban, on its front, he put the golden plate, the holy crown, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Also Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the laver and its base, to consecrate them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aarons head and anointed him, to consecrate him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses brought Aarons sons and put tunics on them, girded them with sashes, and tied the turbans on them, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he brought the bull of the sin offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Moses killed it. And he took the blood, and put some on the horns of the altar all around with his finger, and purified the altar. And he poured the blood at the base of the altar, and consecrated it, to make atonement on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he took all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe attached to the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them with smoke like incense on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the bull, its hide, its flesh, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he brought the ram as the burnt offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Moses killed it. And he sprinkled the blood all around on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burned the head, the pieces, and the fat with smoke like incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he washed the entrails and the legs in water. And Moses burned the whole ram on the altar with smoke like incense. It was a burnt offering for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire unto Jehovah, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he brought the second ram, the ram of ordination. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and Moses killed it. And he took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aarons right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he brought Aarons sons, and Moses put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. And Moses sprinkled the blood all around on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he took the fat and the fat tail, all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe attached to the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and from the basket of unleavened bread that was before Jehovah he took one unleavened cake, a cake of bread anointed with oil, and one wafer, and put them on the fat and on the right thigh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he put all these in Aarons hands and in his sons hands, and waved them as a wave offering before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses took them from their hands and burned them with smoke upon the altar, upon the burnt offering. They were ordination offerings for a soothing aroma; an offering by fire unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before Jehovah. It was Moses portion of the ram of ordination, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he consecrated Aaron, his garments, his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I have commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And whatever remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And you shall not go outside the door of the tent of meeting for seven days, for the days of your ordination to be fulfilled. For seven days he shall confirm your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As he has done this day, thus Jehovah has commanded to do, to make atonement for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore you shall stay at the door of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days, and keep the charge of Jehovah, so that you may not die; for thus I have been commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus Aaron and his sons did all the things that Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
