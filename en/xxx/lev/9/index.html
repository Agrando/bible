And all the congregation drew near and stood before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded you to do, and the glory of Jehovah shall appear unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Go to the altar, offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. Offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Jehovah has commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Aaron therefore went to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him. And he dipped his finger in the blood, put it on the horns of the altar, and poured the blood at the base of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe from the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar with smoke, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he killed the burnt offering; and Aarons sons presented the blood to him, which he sprinkled all around on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they presented the burnt offering to him, with its pieces and head, and he burned them on the altar with smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he washed the entrails and the legs, and burned them with smoke with the burnt offering on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he brought the peoples offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and killed it and offered it for sin, like the first one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he brought the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar with smoke, besides the burnt offering of the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He also killed the bull and the ram as sacrifices of peace offerings, which were for the people. And Aarons sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the fat from the bull and the ram; the fatty tail, that covers the entrails and the kidneys, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and they put the fat on the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar with smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved as a wave offering before Jehovah, as Moses had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Aaron lifted his hand toward the people, blessed them, and came down from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out and blessed the people. And the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. When all the people saw it, they cried aloud and fell on their faces.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
