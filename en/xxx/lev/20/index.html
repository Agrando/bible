The people of the land shall stone him with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I will set My face against that man, and will cut him off from his people, because he has given his seed to Molech, to defile My sanctuary and profane My holy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if the people of the land should conceal to hide their eyes from the man, when he gives his seed to Molech, and they do not kill him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>then I will set My face against that man and against his family; and I will cut him off from his people, along with all who prostitute themselves with him to commit adultery with Molech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the soul who turns to mediums and fortunetellers, to commit adultery with them, I will set My face against that soul and cut him off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall keep My statutes, and do them: I am Jehovah who sanctifies you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And each one who curses his father or his mother shall be executed to death. He has cursed his father or his mother. His blood shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The man who commits adultery with another mans wife, he who commits adultery with his neighbors wife, the adulterer and the adulteress, shall be executed to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The man who lies with his fathers wife has uncovered his fathers nakedness; both of them shall be executed to death. Their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall be executed to death. They have brought about perversion. Their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If a man lies with a male as one lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall be executed to death. Their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If a man marries a woman and her mother, it is wickedness. They shall be burned with fire, both he and they, that there may be no wickedness in your midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a man mates with a beast, he shall be executed to death, and you shall kill the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If a woman approaches any beast and mates with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast. They shall die the death. Their blood is upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If a man takes his sister, his fathers daughter or his mothers daughter, and gives attention to her nakedness and she gives attention to his nakedness, it is shameful. And they shall be cut off in the eyes of the sons of their people. He has uncovered his sisters nakedness. He shall bear his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If a man lies with a woman when she is unwell and uncovers her nakedness, he has exposed her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood. Both of them shall be cut off from among their people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mothers sister nor of your fathers sister, for that would uncover his near of kin. They shall bear their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If a man lies with his aunt, he has uncovered his uncles nakedness. They shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If a man takes his brothers wife, it is an unclean thing. He has uncovered his brothers nakedness. They shall be childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall therefore keep all My statutes and all My judgments, and do them, that the land where I am bringing you to dwell may not vomit you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you shall not walk in the statutes of the nations which I am casting out before you; for they have done all these things, and therefore I abhor them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I have said to you, You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am Jehovah your God, who has set you apart from the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You shall therefore distinguish between clean beasts and unclean, between unclean flying creatures and clean, and you shall not make your souls detestable by beast or by flying creature, or by any kind of living thing that moves on the ground, which I have set apart from you as unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And you shall be holy unto Me, for I, Jehovah, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that you should be Mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A man or a woman who is a medium or a fortuneteller shall be executed to death; they shall stone them with stones. Their blood shall be upon them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
