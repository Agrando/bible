And Aaron kept still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So they went near and carried them out of the camp by their tunics, as Moses had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons, Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, that you not die, and wrath come upon all the people. But let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Jehovah has kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah spoke to Aaron, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not drink wine or strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, that you not die. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>to make a distinction between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons who were left: Take the grain offering that remains of the offerings by fire unto Jehovah, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is set apart, holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You shall eat it in the holy place, because it is your due and your sons due, of the sacrifices by fire unto Jehovah; for thus I have been commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering you shall eat in a clean place, you, your sons, and your daughters with you; for they are your due and your sons due, which are given from the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The thigh of the heave offering and the breast of the wave offering they shall bring with the offerings of fat by fire, to offer as a wave offering before Jehovah. And it shall be yours and your sons with you, by a perpetual statute, as Jehovah has commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Moses investigated to inquire about the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up. And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Why have you not eaten the sin offering in a holy place, since it is set apart, holy, and God has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, its blood has not been brought inside the holy place; indeed you should have eaten it in the holy place, as I have commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before Jehovah, and such things have befallen me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been accepted in the eyes of Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when Moses heard that, it was good in his eyes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
