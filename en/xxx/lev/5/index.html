Thus the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring unto Jehovah, for his guilt which he has sinned, two turtledoves or two young pigeons: one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and nip off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it completely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he shall offer the second as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. Thus the priest shall make atonement for his sin which he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he who sinned shall bring for his offering one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering. He shall put no oil on it, nor shall he put frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his full handful of it as a memorial portion, and burn it on the altar with smoke according to the offerings by fire unto Jehovah. It is a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The priest shall make atonement for him, for his sin that he has sinned in any of these matters; and it shall be forgiven him.

Thus the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If a soul sins, and has done any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of Jehovah, though he does not know it, yet he is guilty and shall bear his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he shall bring to the priest a ram that is whole from the flock, with your valuation, as a trespass offering. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him regarding his unintentional error in which he did not know it, and it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is a trespass offering; he has trespassed against Jehovah to become guilty.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
