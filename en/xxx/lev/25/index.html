You shall neither sow your field nor prune your vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>What grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap, nor gather the grapes of your untended vine, for it is a year of rest for the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the sabbath of the land shall be food for you: for you, your male and female servants, your hired man, and the stranger who sojourns with you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for your livestock and the beasts that are in your land; all its produce shall be for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall count seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years; and the time of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to you forty-nine years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then you shall cause the shofar of jubilation to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement you shall make the shofar to pass throughout all your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a Jubilee for you; and each of you shall return to his possession, and each of you shall return to his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The fiftieth year shall be a Jubilee to you; in it you shall neither sow nor reap what grows of its own accord, nor gather the grapes of your untended vine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is the Jubilee; it shall be holy to you; you shall eat its produce from the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the Year of Jubilee, each of you shall return to his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if you sell anything to your neighbor or buy from your neighbors hand, you shall not oppress one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor, and according to the number of years of crops he shall sell to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>According to the multitude of years you shall increase its price, and according to the fewer number of years you shall diminish its price; for he sells to you according to the number of the crops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore you shall not oppress one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus you shall do My statutes and keep My judgments, and do them; and you shall dwell in the land in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell there in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if you say, What shall we eat in the seventh year, since we shall not sow nor gather in our produce?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall produce crops enough for three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall sow in the eighth year, and eat old produce until the ninth year; until its produce comes in, you shall eat of the old harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is Mine; for you are strangers and sojourners with Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in all the land of your possession you shall grant redemption of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If one of your brethren becomes poor, and has sold some of his possession, and if his redeeming relative comes to redeem it, then he may redeem what his brother sold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Or if the man has no one to redeem it, but he himself becomes able to redeem it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>then let him count the years since its sale, and restore the remainder to the man to whom he sold it, that he may return to his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if he is not able to have it restored to himself, then what was sold shall remain in the hand of him who bought it until the Year of Jubilee; and in the Jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If a man sells a house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year he may redeem it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house in the walled city shall be confirmed permanently to him who bought it, throughout his generations. It shall not go out in the Jubilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>However the houses of villages which have no wall around them shall be considered as the fields of the land. They may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the Jubilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, and the houses in the cities of their possession, the Levites always have the right of redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if a man redeems a house from the Levites, then the house that was sold in the city of his possession shall go out in the Jubilee; for the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the field of the common land of their cities shall not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If one of your brethren becomes poor, and his hand has become shaky, then you shall support him, like a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Take no usury or interest from him; but fear your God, that your brother may live with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>You shall not give him your money at interest, nor give him your food at a profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I am Jehovah your God, who has brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And if one of your brethren who dwells by you becomes poor, and has sold himself to you, you shall not compel him to serve as a slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As a hired servant and a sojourner he shall be with you, and shall serve you until the Year of Jubilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And then he shall depart from you; he and his children with him; and shall return to his own family. He shall return to the possession of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For they are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You shall not rule over him with harshness, but you shall fear your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And as for your male and female slaves whom you may have from the nations that are around you, from them you shall buy male and female slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Moreover you shall buy the children of the strangers who sojourn among you, and their families who are with you, which they beget in your land; and they shall be your property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them as a possession; they shall be your permanent slaves. But regarding your brethren, the children of Israel, you shall not rule over one another with harshness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Now if a sojourner or stranger close to you becomes rich, and one of your brethren who dwells by him becomes poor, and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner close to you, or to a member of the strangers family,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>after he is sold he may be redeemed again. One of his brothers may redeem him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>or his uncle or his uncles son may redeem him; or anyone who is near of kin to him in his family may redeem him; or if he is able he may redeem himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Thus he shall reckon with him who bought him: The price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, from the year that he was sold to him until the Year of Jubilee; it shall be according to the time of a hired servant for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>If there are still many years remaining, according to them he shall repay the price of his redemption from the money with which he was bought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And if there remain but a few years until the Year of Jubilee, then he shall reckon with him, and according to his years he shall repay him the price of his redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He shall be with him year by year as a hired servant, and he shall not rule with harshness over him before your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And if he is not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the Year of Jubilee; he and his children with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For the children of Israel are servants to Me; they are My servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
