And when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they departed from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the Word of Jehovah came unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: You shall say this to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: Behold, Pharaohs army, which has come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city, and capture it, and burn it with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus says Jehovah: Do not deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us. For they shall not depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For though you had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained only wounded men among them, they would rise up, each man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened when the army of Chaldeans went up from Jerusalem because of Pharaohs army,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to claim his property there in the midst of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a commander of the guard named Irijah was there, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah. And he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You are defecting to the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jeremiah said, False! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans. But he did not listen to him; so Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the rulers were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison, the house of Jonathan the scribe. For they had made that the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When Jeremiah had entered into the dungeon and the cell, and Jeremiah had remained there many days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>then Zedekiah the king sent and took him out. And the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any Word from Jehovah? And Jeremiah said, There is. For, He said, you shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, What have I offended against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you nor against this land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore please hear now, O my lord the king; I beg you, let my supplication fall before you, so that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Zedekiah the king commanded that they should put Jeremiah into the court of the guard, and that they should give him a piece of bread out of the bakers street daily, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus, Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
