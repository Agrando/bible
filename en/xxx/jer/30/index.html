And I will cause them to return to the land that I gave their fathers, and they shall possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And these are the Words that Jehovah spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For thus says Jehovah, We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ask now, and see whether a man ever gives birth? Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, like a woman in labor, and all faces are turned pale?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Alas! For that day is great, so that none is like it; it is even the time of Jacobs trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For it shall come to pass in that day, says Jehovah of Hosts, that I will break his yoke from your neck and will burst your bonds. And strangers shall no longer enslave him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore, do not fear, O My servant Jacob, says Jehovah. Do not be dismayed, O Israel. For lo, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity. And Jacob shall return, and shall be at rest, and be quiet, and no one shall make him afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I am with you, says Jehovah, to save you. Though I make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you, yet I will not make a complete end of you; but I will correct you in justice, and will not acquit nor leave you unpunished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus says Jehovah, Your break is incurable, and your wound is making you sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is no one to plead your cause; for your wounds there are no healing medicines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All your lovers have forgotten you; they do not seek you. For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the abundance of your iniquity, because your sins are many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Why do you cry over your break? Your pain is incurable, because of the abundance of your iniquities; because your sins have increased, I have done these things to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity. And those who plunder you shall become plunder, and all who prey upon you I will give as prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will stir up health to you, and will heal you of your wounds, says Jehovah; because they called you an outcast, saying, This is Zion; no one seeks after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will bring back the captives of Jacobs tents, and will have mercy on his dwelling places. And the city shall be built on her own hill, and the palace shall remain in its own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And out of them shall come forth thanksgiving, and the voice of those who make merry. And I will multiply them, and they shall not diminish; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Their children shall also be as they were before, and their congregation shall be established before Me, and I will punish all who oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And their rulers shall be from among themselves, and their governor shall come from their midst; and I will cause him to be brought near, and he shall draw near to Me. For who is this who pledged his heart to come near to Me? says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall be My people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, the tempest of Jehovahs wrath goes forth, a roaring tempest; it shall whirl on the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return until He has done it, and until He has fulfilled the purposes of His heart. In the latter days you shall understand it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
