Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am a youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jehovah said to me, Do not say, I am a youth; for you shall go to all to whom I shall send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you to deliver you, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah put forth His hand, and touched my mouth. And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I have put My Words in your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what do you see? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehovah said to me, You have seen well; for I will keep watch over My Word to perform it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying, What do you see? And I said, I see a boiling pot; and its face is facing north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah said to me, Out of the north an evil will be unleashed upon all the inhabitants of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Jehovah; and they shall come, and they shall each one set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will pronounce My judgments against them regarding all their evil, those who have forsaken Me, and burned incense to other gods, and bowed down to the works of their own hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You therefore gird up your loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed at their faces, lest I shame you before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For behold, I have made you a fortified city this day, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its rulers, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you. For I am with you, says Jehovah, to deliver you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
