May Jehovah do so. May Jehovah establish your words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of Jehovahs house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But hear now this word that I speak in your ears and in the ears of all the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms; of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then the prophet shall be known, that Jehovah has truly sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiahs neck and broke it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the time frame of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the Word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off of the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah: You have broken the yokes of wood, but you have made in their place yokes of iron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And they shall serve him. And I have given him the beasts of the field also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah has not sent you, but you make this people to trust in a lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will drive you from off the face of the earth. You shall die this year, because you have taught rebellion against Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
