For you have kindled a fire in My anger, which shall burn forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says Jehovah, Cursed is the man who trusts in man, and makes flesh his strength, and whose heart departs from Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For he shall be destitute in the wilderness, and shall not see when good comes. But he shall live in the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land that is not inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah, and Jehovah is his refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters; it sends out its roots by the river, and it shall not fear when the heat comes, but its foliage shall be green; and he is not anxious in the year of drought, nor will it cease from yielding fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I Jehovah search the heart, I examine the soul, even to give to each man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The partridge sets on eggs and does not hatch them; in the same way he who gets riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the middle of his days, and at his end he shall be a fool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O Jehovah, the Hope of Israel, all who forsake You shall be ashamed. Those who depart from Me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Jehovah, the Fountain of Living Waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Heal me, O Jehovah, and I shall be healed, save me, and I shall be saved; for You are my praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, they say to me, Where is the Word of Jehovah? Let it come now!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for me, I have not hurried away from being a shepherd who follows You; nor have I desired the woeful day; You surely know the going forth of my lips before Your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do not be a terror to me; You are my hope in the day of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let those who persecute me be ashamed, but do not let me be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but do not let me be dismayed. Bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus Jehovah said unto me: Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, by which the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and say to them, Hear the Word of Jehovah, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter by these gates!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus says Jehovah, Take heed to yourselves, and carry no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nor carry out a burden from your houses on the Sabbath day, nor do any work, but consecrate the Sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they did not obey, nor extend their ear, but made their neck stiff, so that they might not hear nor receive instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall be, if you listen and give heed to Me, says Jehovah, to bring no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but consecrate the Sabbath day, to do no work in it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>then kings and rulers sitting on the throne of David shall enter the gates of this city, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their rulers, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city shall remain forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places around Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the valleys, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and grain offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise to the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But if you will not listen to me to consecrate the Sabbath day, to not carry a burden when entering at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
