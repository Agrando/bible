And Jeremiah the prophet was shut in the court of the guard, which was in the house of the king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy and say, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall be given over and delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and he shall lead Zedekiah into Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit him, says Jehovah; though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jeremiah said, The Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours, to buy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Hanamel my uncles son came to me in the court of the guard according to the Word of Jehovah and said to me, Please buy my field in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the right of redemption is yours. Buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the Word of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I bought the field in Anathoth, from Hanamel my uncles son, and weighed him the money, seventeen shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I wrote it in the document, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed the silver in the scales.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So I took the document of the purchase, that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and the open copy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I gave the document of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the eyes of Hanamel my uncles son, and in the eyes of the witnesses who wrote in the purchase document, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Take these documents, the purchase document, the one sealed and the open document, and put them in an earthen vessel so that they may survive many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall be acquired again in this land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And after I gave the purchase document to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Jehovah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ah, Lord Jehovah! You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You show lovingkindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them. The great, the strong and Mighty God, Jehovah of Hosts, is His name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>great in counsel and mighty in work; for Your eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, and in Israel and among men; and have made Yourself a name, as it is this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and have brought forth Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And You have given them this land, which You swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they came in and possessed it, but they have not obeyed Your voice, nor walked in Your Law. They have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have caused all this evil to come upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, the siege mounds have come to the city to take it; and the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine, and the pestilence. And what You have spoken has happened; and behold, there You see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And You have said to me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy the field for money, and take witnesses; yet the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the Word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, I am Jehovah the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke Me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only evil before Me from their youth. For the children of Israel have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it, even to this day; that I should remove it from before My face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger; they, their kings, their rulers, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they have turned the back to Me, and not the face; though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they built the high places of Baal, in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I did not command them, nor did it even enter My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And now therefore, thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands where I have driven them in My anger, and in My fury, and in great wrath. And I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they shall be My people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me forever, for their good and for the good of their children after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good. But I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will truly plant them in this land, with all My heart and all My soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For thus says Jehovah: Just as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And fields shall be bought in this land of which you say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Men shall buy fields for money, and write it in a document, and seal it, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south. For I will cause their captives to return, says Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
