And he went out the way of the plain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And they took him, and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes in Riblah. The king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Moreover he put out Zedekiahs eyes and bound him with chains, to bring him to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Chaldeans burned the kings house and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive to Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city, and those who fell out and defected to him, with the rest of the people that remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poor people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Take him and look after him, and do him no evil; but do with him even as he says to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the princes of the king of Babylon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>even they sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and assigned him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, to take him home.

And they shall be done in that day before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But I will deliver you in that day, says Jehovah. And you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I will give you an escape, to deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life shall be as a prize to you, because you have put your trust in Me, says Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
