And there they ate bread together at Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass on the second day after he had killed Gedaliah (and no one yet knew it),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that some men from Shechem came from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, with their beards shaved, and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he walked. And it happened as he met them that he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And so it happened when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, he and the men with him, and threw them into the middle of the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, Do not kill us, for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he left off and did not kill them with their brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the pit into which Ishmael had thrown all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had killed because of Gedaliah, was the one which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, even the kingÂ’s daughters and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had entrusted to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took captive and departed to go over to the Ammonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. And they found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it happened when all the people with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces with him, that they were glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So all the people that Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; the mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the officials, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they departed and stayed in the lodging place of Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, to go to enter Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
