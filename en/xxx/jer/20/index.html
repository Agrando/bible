Then Jeremiah said to him, Jehovah has not called your name Pashur, but Magor-Missabib.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. And they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see it. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and kill them with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I will give all the wealth of this city, and its produce, and all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; who will plunder them and take them, and bring them to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you, Pashur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. And you shall go to Babylon, and you shall die there, and shall be buried there; you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O Jehovah, You have deceived me, and I was deceived. You are stronger than I, and You have prevailed. I am in derision all the day; everyone mocks me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For whenever I speak, I cry out, I cry violence and devastation; for the Word of Jehovah has been a reproach and a derision to me all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I said, I will not make mention of Him, nor speak in His name any more. But His Word was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with holding it in, and I could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I have heard the whisperings of many, terror is all around. Proclaim, they say, and we will report it. Everyone at peace with me is watching for me to stumble and fall, saying, Perhaps he will be lured away, and we shall prevail against him, and shall take our revenge on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Jehovah is with me like a mighty, awesome one. Therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail. They shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not succeed. Their everlasting reproach shall never be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, O Jehovah of Hosts, who tries the righteous and sees the soul and the heart, let me see Your vengeance on them. For I have made my cause known to You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing to Jehovah! Praise Jehovah! For He has delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Cursed be the day in which I was born; let not the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Cursed be the man who brought news to my father, saying, A male child has been born to you; making him very glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew without compassion; and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because he did not kill me from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb always pregnant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why did I come forth from the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
