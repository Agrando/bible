You shall again put on your tambourines, and shall go forth in the dances of those who rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You shall yet plant vines on the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For there shall be a day that the watchmen on Mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise and let us go up to Zion unto Jehovah our God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For thus says Jehovah, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations. Cry out, give praise and say, O Jehovah, save Your people, the remnant of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I will bring them from the land of the north and gather them from the recesses of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and she who is in labor with child, together; a great company shall return there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They shall come with weeping, and with supplications I will lead them. I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way; they shall not stumble in it, for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is My firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the Word of Jehovah, O nations, and declare it on distant shores; and say, He who scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For Jehovah has redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of the one stronger than him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of Jehovah, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and the herd. And their souls shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not languish any more at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and My people shall be satisfied with My goodness, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus says Jehovah: A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says Jehovah: Refrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears; for your work shall be rewarded, says Jehovah. And they shall come back from the land of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there is hope for your future, says Jehovah, that your children shall come back to their own territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself, saying, You have chastised me, and I was chastised, like an untrained bull; draw me back, and I shall return. For You are Jehovah my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Surely after I was turned back, I repented; and after I was instructed, I struck my thigh. I was ashamed, yes, even humiliated, because I bore the reproach of my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a delightful child? For as often as I spoke against him, I call to mind and remember him still. Therefore My heart is stirred for him; I will have mercy and compassion upon him, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Set up signposts, make landmarks for yourself. Set your heart toward the highway, the way you went. Turn back, O virgin of Israel, turn back to these cities of yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>How long will you vacillate, O backsliding daughter? For Jehovah has created a new thing in the earth; a woman shall contain a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, They shall speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I shall bring back their captives, saying, Jehovah bless you, O habitation of justice and mountain of holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And farmers, and those going forth with flocks, shall dwell together in Judah and in all its cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have satisfied every sorrowful soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>After this I awoke and looked around; and my sleep was sweet to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall come to pass that, as I have watched over them to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In those days they shall not say any more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are dull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But every man shall die for his own iniquity. Every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be dull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel: After those days, says Jehovah, I will put My Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they shall no more teach each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Jehovah. For I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus says Jehovah, who gives the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea when its waves roar (Jehovah of Hosts is His name);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>if those ordinances depart from My presence, says Jehovah, then the seed of Israel shall also cease from being a nation before Me forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus says Jehovah, If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be searched out, then I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that the city shall be built to Jehovah from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the measuring line shall come out to the hill Gareb, and shall go around to Goath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields as far as the Kidron Valley, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be holy to Jehovah. It shall not be plucked up nor thrown down any more forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
