And the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Jehovah said to me, What do you see, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs are very good, and the bad are very bad, so that they cannot be eaten, they are so bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will acknowledge the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land.
