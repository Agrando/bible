But he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life as a prize, and shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thus says Jehovah: This city shall be given and bestowed into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall seize it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore the rulers said to the king, Please let this man be put to death. For in this way he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man does not seek the welfare of this people, but their harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand. For the king cannot do a thing against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they took Jeremiah and threw him into the pit of Malchijah the son of Hammelech, which was in the court of the guard. And they let Jeremiah down with ropes. And there was no water in the pit, only mud. So Jeremiah sank into the mud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the officials in the kings house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the pit (the king was then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ebed-melech went out of the kings house and spoke to the king, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have thrown into the pit. And he is likely to die of hunger in the place where he is, for there is no more bread in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take by your hand thirty men from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet up out of the pit before he dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Ebed-melech took the men by his hand and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took worn out clothes and worn out rags from there, and let them down by ropes into the pit to Jeremiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Now put the worn out clothes and rags under your armpits, under the ropes. And Jeremiah did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they drew up Jeremiah with ropes and took him up out of the pit. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Zedekiah the king sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third gate of the house of Jehovah. And the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you something. Do not hide anything from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not execute me to death? And if I give you advice, you will not give heed to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As Jehovah lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death, nor will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, Thus says Jehovah the God of Hosts, the God of Israel: If you will come out and go forth to the rulers of the king of Babylon, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire. And you and your house shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you will not go forth to the rulers of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they abuse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you. I beg of you, obey the voice of Jehovah which I am speaking to you; so it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if you refuse to surrender, this is the Word that Jehovah has shown me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, all the women who are left in the house of the king of Judah shall be brought out to the rulers of the king of Babylon, and they shall say, Your friends have enticed you, and have prevailed against you. Your feet have sunk in the mire, and they have turned away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans. And you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. And this city shall be burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if the rulers hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say to you, Declare to us now what you have said to the king, and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us, and we will not put you to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then you shall say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathans house, to die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then all the rulers came to Jeremiah and asked him. And he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they quit speaking with him; for the conversation had not been heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was captured. And he was there when Jerusalem was captured.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
