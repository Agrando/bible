Then I answered and said, Amen, O Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jehovah said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For I admonished and testified to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, until this day, rising early and exhorting, saying, Obey My voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet they did not obey nor extend their ear, but walked each one in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did not do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear My Words. And they went after other gods, to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore Jehovah says this: Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to Me, I will not listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to whom they offer incense. But they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah. And according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to that shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry out to Me because of their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is My beloved doing in My house, since she has worked out many evil devices? Has the holy flesh taken away your evil from you? How then do you rejoice?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jehovah called your name, Green Olive Tree, fair, with fine fruit. With a great roaring sound He has set fire to it, and its branches are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Jehovah of Hosts who planted you has pronounced evil against you, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke Me to anger by offering incense to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehovah gave me knowledge of it, and I made it known; for You showed me their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I was like a docile lamb being led to the slaughter. And I did not know that they had devised schemes against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name may be remembered no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, O Jehovah of Hosts, who judges righteously, who tries the mind and the heart, let me see Your vengeance on them. For to You I have laid open my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth who seek your life, saying, Do not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that you do not die by our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and there shall be no remnant of them. For I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their punishment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
