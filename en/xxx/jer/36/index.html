And Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the Words of Jehovah, which He had spoken to him, on a scroll of a book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am confined. I cannot go into the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written at my mouth, the Words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in Jehovahs house on the day of the fast. And also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It may be that they will present their supplication before Jehovah, and will turn back, each one from his evil way. For great is the anger and the fury that Jehovah has pronounced against this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book, the Words of Jehovah in the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before Jehovah to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah, in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entrance to the New Gate of the house of Jehovah, in the ears of all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When Michaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the Words of Jehovah from the book,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>he then went down to the kings house, into the scribes room. And, lo, all the rulers sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore all the rulers sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take the scroll in your hand from which you have read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it happened when they had heard all the words, that they turned to one another in fear and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Baruch answered them, He spoke all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the rulers said to Baruch, Go hide yourselves, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they went in to the king, into the court. But they laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll. And he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the rulers who stood beside the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, the fire burning in the hearth before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it happened, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that he cut it with the scribes knife and threw it into the fire in the hearth, until all the scroll was burned up in the hearth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yet the king and all his servants who heard these words were not afraid, nor did they tear their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had entreated the king that he should not burn the scroll, but he would not consent to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But Jehovah hid them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch had written at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take for yourself another scroll, and write in it all the former Words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And you shall say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus says Jehovah: You have burned this scroll, saying, Why have you written in it, saying that the king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause man and beast to be annihilated from there?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David. And his dead body shall be cast out into the heat of the day, and the frost of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity. And I will bring upon them, and upon the people of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have spoken against them; but they have not given heed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote in it at the mouth of Jeremiah all the Words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many words like them were added to them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
