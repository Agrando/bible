And they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the welfare that I am bringing to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus says Jehovah: Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say is desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who shall say, Praise Jehovah of Hosts, for Jehovah is good, for His mercy is eternal; and the voice of those who shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of Jehovah. For I will cause the captives of the land to return, as at the first, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Again in this place which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all its cities, there shall be a dwelling place of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him who counts them, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will establish the good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days, and at that time, I will cause the Branch of Righteousness to grow up to David; and He shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days Judah shall be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely. And this is the name by which she shall be called: JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus says Jehovah, David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>nor shall the priests, the Levites, lack a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle grain offerings, and to sacrifice continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus says Jehovah: If you can break My covenant of the day and My covenant of the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then also may My covenant with David My servant be broken, that he should not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levites the priests, My ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As the host of the heavens cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so I will multiply the seed of David My servant and the Levites who serve Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do you not consider what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which Jehovah has chosen, He has even cast them off? Thus they have despised My people, that they should no more be a nation before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus says Jehovah: If My covenant is not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of the heavens and the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then I will cast away the seed of Jacob, and David My servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will bring back their captives, and have mercy on them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
