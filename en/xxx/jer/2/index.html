All that devour him shall be held guilty; evil shall come upon them, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hear the Word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says Jehovah, What injustice have your fathers found in Me, that they have gone far from Me and have walked after vanity, and have become vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Nor did they say, Where is Jehovah who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of dry places, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man lived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat its fruit and its goodness; but when you entered, you defiled My land and made My inheritance an abomination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The priests did not say, Where is Jehovah? And they who handle the Law did not know Me; the shepherds also rebelled against Me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I will contend with you, says Jehovah, and with your childrenÂ’s children I will make a complaint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For pass over the coasts of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider carefully, and see if there is such a thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Has a nation changed their gods, which are not gods? But My people have changed their Glory for that which does not profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be appalled, O heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid; be greatly desolated, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the Fountain of Living Waters, to hew out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is Israel a servant? Or is he a homeborn slave? Why is he plundered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The young lions roared against him; they uttered their voice. And they made his land a waste; his cities are burned without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also the children of Noph and Tahpanhes have fed on your crown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Have you not brought this upon yourself, in that you have forsaken Jehovah your God, when He led you by the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now what are you doing on the way toward Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? Or what are you doing, going toward Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your own evil shall correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you. Therefore know and see that it is an evil and bitter thing that you have forsaken Jehovah your God, and that My fear is not in you, says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For long ago you broke your yoke and tore apart your bonds; and you said, I will not transgress, when on every high hill and under every green tree you lay down like a harlot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet I planted you a noble vine, a true seed. How then have you turned into the degenerate shoots of an alien vine to Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is stained before Me, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How can you say, I am not defiled; I have not gone after the Baals? See your way in the valley, know what you have done! You are a swift camel crisscrossing its ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A wild ass used to the wilderness, in her cravings she sniffs at the wind; when she is in heat who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they will find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Withhold your foot from being bare, and your throat from thirst. But you said, There is no hope. No! For I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As the thief is ashamed when he is found out, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their rulers, and their priests, and their prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>saying to a tree, You are my father; and to a stone, You gave birth to me. For they have turned their back to Me, and not their face; but in the time of their distress they will say, Arise and save us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your distress; for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Why will you plead with Me? You all have rebelled against Me, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In vain I have chastened your children; they received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>O generation, see the Word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of darkness? Why do My people say, We roam freely; we will come no more to You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me days without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Why do you beautify your way to seek love? Therefore you have also taught the evil women your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents; I did not find them by secret search, but plainly on all these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Yet you say, Because I am innocent, surely His anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with you, because you say, I have not sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Why do you gad about so much to change your way? You also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Indeed, you shall go out from this place, with your hands on your head. For Jehovah has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper by them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
