Send them out of My sight, and let them go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it shall come to pass that if they say to you, Where shall we go? Then you shall tell them, Thus says Jehovah: Those who are for death, to death; and those for the sword, to the sword; and those for the famine, to the famine; and those for the captivity, to the captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will set over them four kinds, says Jehovah; the sword to kill, and the dogs to drag, and the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will make them a horror to all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For who shall have pity on you, O Jerusalem? Or who shall bemoan you? Or who shall turn aside to ask after your welfare?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have forsaken Me, says Jehovah; you have gone backward; therefore I will stretch out My hand against you, and destroy you; I am weary with sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will winnow them with a pitch fork in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children; I will destroy My people, since they have not turned back from their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their widows are more numerous around Me than the sand of the seas; I have brought on them, against a mother of a young man, a plunderer at noonday; I have caused anguish and terror to fall suddenly upon the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>She who bore seven languishes; she has breathed out her life; her sun has gone down while it was yet day. She has been ashamed and confounded; and I will deliver the rest of them to the sword before their enemies, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me, a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither loaned with usury, nor have men loaned to me; yet every one curses me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah said, Truly I will not free you for good. Truly I will cause the enemy to entreat you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can anyone break iron, iron or bronze from the north?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Your wealth and your treasures I will give as spoils without price, because of all your sins, even in all your borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will make you pass over with your enemies into a land which you do not know. For a fire has been kindled in My anger, which shall burn against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>O Jehovah, You know; remember me and visit me, and take vengeance for me on those who persecute me. In Your long-suffering do not take me away; know that for Your sake I have suffered rebuke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Your Words were found, and I ate them; and Your Word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart; for I am called by Your name, O Jehovah the God of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I did not sit in the council of the mockers, nor rejoice; I sat alone because of Your hand; for You have filled me with indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why has my pain been continual, and my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? You surely are to me like deceitful waters that cannot be trusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus says Jehovah, If you turn back, then I will bring you back again; you shall stand before Me. And if you take the precious out from the vile, you shall be as My mouth. Let them turn back to you, but do not return to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will make you to this people a fortified wall of bronze; and they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the grip of the terrible.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
