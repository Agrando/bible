Behold, I, even I, have seen it, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But go now to My place which was in Shiloh, where I set My name at the first, and see what I did to it because of the evil of My people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now, because you have done all these works, says Jehovah, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you did not hear; and I called you, but you did not answer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>therefore I will do to this house, which is called by My name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, the whole seed of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry nor prayer for them, nor make intercession to Me; for I will not hear you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke Me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do they provoke Me to anger? says Jehovah. Is it not themselves, to the shame of their own faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, My anger and My fury shall be poured out on this place, on man, and on beast, and on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Snatch away your burnt offerings from your sacrifices, and eat flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I did not speak to your fathers, nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But this is what I commanded them, saying, Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be My people; and walk in all the ways that I have commanded you, so that it may be well with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But they did not listen, nor extend their ear, but walked in their own plans, in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day I have even sent to you all My servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yet they did not listen to Me, nor extend their ear, but hardened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you; you shall also call to them, but they will not answer you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But you shall say to them, This is a nation which does not obey the voice of Jehovah their God, nor receives instruction; truth has perished, and is cut off from their mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Cut off your hair and throw it away, and take up a lamentation on the desolate heights. For Jehovah has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the sons of Judah have done evil in My eyes, says Jehovah. They have set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, in order to defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I did not command them, nor did it even come into My heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. For they shall bury in Tophet, until there is no more room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth; and no one will frighten them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then I will cause the voice of gladness to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride. For the land shall be desolate.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
