Kirjathaim is dried up and captured. The Fortress is dried up and dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>No more praise of Moab. In Heshbon they have plotted evil against it, saying, Come and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also you shall be silenced, O madmen; the sword shall pursue you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A voice of crying shall be heard from Horonaim, plundering and great destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For at the ascent to Luhith they go up with continual weeping; for at the descent from Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Flee, save your lives, and be like a bush in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures, you shall also be captured. And Chemosh shall go into captivity along with his priests and his rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the robber shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape. Also the valley shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as Jehovah has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Give wings to Moab so that it may flee and get away; for its cities shall be desolate, without an inhabitant in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Cursed is he who does the work of Jehovah deceitfully, and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his dregs and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, nor has he gone into captivity. Therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent has not changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will send ones to lean him, tip him over, and empty his vessels, and shatter his jars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How can you say, We are mighty and strong men for war?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moab is plundered and has gone up out of her cities. And his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter, says the King, whose name is Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hurries quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All you who are around him, mourn him. And all you who know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken; the beautiful rod!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O daughter dwelling in Dibon, come down from your glory and sit in thirst. For the plunderer of Moab has come upon you; he has destroyed your strongholds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch. Ask him who flees and her who escapes; say, What is happening?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moab is withered up, and it is broken down. Howl and cry! Tell it in Arnon that Moab is plundered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And judgment has come upon the plains; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and upon Kirjathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Make him drunk, for he magnified himself against Jehovah. Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be an object of derision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For was not Israel an object of derision to you? Was he found among thieves? For ever since you spoke of him, you skipped for joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>O you who dwell in Moab, leave the cities and live in the rock, and be like the dove that makes her nest in the sides of the mouth of the cave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We have heard of the pride of Moab (he is exceedingly proud), his loftiness, and his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I know his wrath, says Jehovah, but it is not so; his boast, but they have not done it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore I will wail for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab, and shall mourn for the men of Kir-hares.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for you with the weeping of Jazer. Your plants have gone over the sea; they reach to the sea of Jazer. A plunderer has fallen upon your summer fruits and upon your vintage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And joy and gladness are taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab. And I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses; no one shall tread the grapes with shouting; no joyous shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>From the cry of Heshbon to Elealeh, and to Jahaz, they have uttered their voice, from Zoar to Horonaim, like a three year old heifer; for the waters of Nimrim also shall be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Moreover, I will put an end to him who offers in the high places in Moab, says Jehovah, who burns incense to his gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore my heart shall mourn for Moab like flutes, and my heart shall mourn like flutes for the men of Kir-hares, because the riches that he has gotten have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped. On all the hands shall be cuttings, and on the loins sackcloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>On all the housetops of Moab, and in its streets, there is weeping for all. For I have broken Moab like a vessel in which no one has pleasure, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! How has Moab turned the back with shame! Thus Moab shall be an object of derision, and a terror to all those around him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For thus says Jehovah: Behold, he shall fly like an eagle and shall spread his wings over Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized; and the mighty menÂ’s hearts in Moab in that day shall be like the heart of a woman in birth pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he has magnified himself against Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Fear and the pit and the snare shall be upon you, O inhabitant of Moab, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He who flees from the terror shall fall into the pit; and he who goes up out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their judgment, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Those who fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon from fatigue, but a fire shall come out from Heshbon, and a flame out of the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab and the crown of the head of the sons of desolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh perish; for your sons have been taken captive, and your daughters into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But I will bring back the captives of Moab in the latter days, says Jehovah. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
