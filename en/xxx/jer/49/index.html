Or has he no heir? Why does their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will cause a shout of war to be heard in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon. And it shall be a heap of ruins, and her daughter-villages shall be burned with fire. Then Israel shall take possession of his inheritance, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wail, O Heshbon; for Ai is plundered! Cry, daughters of Rabbah; clothe yourselves with sackcloth, mourn, and run to and fro by the hedges! For their king shall go into captivity with his priests and his rulers together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Why do you glory in the valleys, your flowing valleys, O backsliding daughter; who trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come against me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, I will bring a fear upon you, says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, from all those who are around you. And you shall be driven out, each man straight forward; and there shall be no one to gather those who stray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And afterward I will bring back the captives of the sons of Ammon, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts to Edom: Is wisdom no more in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom vanished?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Flee, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan. For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him in the time that I will punish him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If the gatherers of grapes had come to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? If thieves had come by night, would they not destroy until they had enough?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I have made Esau bare; I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself. His seed is plundered, and his brothers and his neighbors; and he is no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Leave your orphans; I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus says Jehovah: Behold, those whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have surely drunk. And are you pure and innocent? You shall not be exempt from punishment, but you shall surely drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have sworn by Myself, says Jehovah, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse. And all its cities shall be perpetual wastes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have heard a message from Jehovah, and a messenger is sent to the nations, saying, Gather together and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For lo, I will make you small among the nations, despised among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Your dreadfulness has deceived you, and the pride of your heart, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height of the hill. Though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also Edom shall be an astonishment. Everyone who goes by it shall be appalled and shall hiss at all its plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors, says Jehovah, no man shall remain there, nor shall a son of man live in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the dwelling of the strong. But I will suddenly make him run away from her. And who is a chosen one that I may appoint over her? For who is like Me? And who will summon Me? And who is that shepherd who will stand before Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore hear the counsel of Jehovah which He has taken against Edom, and His purposes which He has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall drag them away; surely He shall desolate their dwellings with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The earth quakes at the sound of their fall; when they cried, its sound was heard at the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, he shall come up and fly like the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah. And in that day the heart of the mighty men of Edom shall be like the heart of a woman in birth pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Concerning Damascus: Hamath and Arpad are put to shame, for they have heard bad news. Their hearts have melted; the sea is anxious; it cannot be quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Damascus has become feeble; she has turned to flee, and trembling has seized her. Anguish and sorrows have taken her like a woman in labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How has the city of praise not been deserted, the city of my joy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be silenced in that day, says Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus says Jehovah concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon shall strike: Arise, go up to Kedar, and plunder the men of the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They shall take away their tents and their flocks. They shall take their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels to themselves. And they shall cry out to them, Fear is on every side!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Flee, go far away, dwell in the depths, O people of Hazor, says Jehovah; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you, and has conceived a plan against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Arise, go up to the nation that is at ease, that dwells securely, says Jehovah, which has neither gates nor bars, which dwells alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And their camels shall be for spoils, and the multitude of their cattle for plunder. And I will scatter them to all the winds, cut off to the farthest extremities. And I will bring their calamity from all sides of it, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Hazor shall be a dwelling for jackals and a desolation forever. No man shall live there, nor any son of man dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Word of Jehovah that came unto Jeremiah the prophet against Elam, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And I will bring the four winds from the four corners of the heavens upon Elam, and will scatter them toward all these winds. And there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies and before those who seek their life. And I will bring evil upon them, even My fierce anger, says Jehovah. And I will send the sword after them until I have finished them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and I will set My throne in Elam, and will destroy the king and the rulers from there, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring back the captives of Elam, says Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
