And I will completely destroy them, and make them a waste, and a hissing, and perpetual ruins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I will take from them the voice of rejoicing and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this whole land shall be a ruin and a waste. And these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are fulfilled, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, and the land of the Chaldeans for their iniquity, says Jehovah; and I will make it a perpetual desolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will bring on that land all My Words which I have spoken against it, all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many nations and great kings shall lay service upon them also. And I will repay them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus says Jehovah the God of Israel to me, Take the wine cup of this wrath from My hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and go mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then I took the cup from JehovahÂ’s hand, and made all the nations drink, to whom Jehovah had sent me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, their kings and their rulers, to make them a desolation, a horror, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and his servants, his rulers, and all his people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and all the people mixed together, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the rest of Ashdod;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Edom, and Moab, and the sons of Ammon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon; and the kings of the coastlands beyond the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and those who are cut off at the remotest regions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the people mixed together who dwell in the desert;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. And the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Drink and be drunk, and vomit, and fall and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall be, that if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, You shall certainly drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For, lo, I am beginning to bring evil on the city which is called by My name; and should you be found clean and free from guilt? You shall not be without guilt, for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, says Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore prophesy against them all these Words, and say to them, Jehovah shall roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation. He shall mightily roar over His dwelling place. He shall give a shout, like those who tread out grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>A roaring noise shall come to the ends of the earth; for Jehovah has a controversy with the nations; He will enter into judgment with all flesh. He will give those who are wicked to the sword, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be roused up from the recesses of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And in that day the slain of Jehovah shall be from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They shall not be mourned, nor gathered, nor buried. They shall be as dung on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Howl, you shepherds, and cry! Wallow in the ashes, you majestic ones of the flock! For the days of your slaughter and of your scattering are fulfilled; and you shall fall like a delightful vessel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the majestic ones of the flock to escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a howling of the majestic ones of the flock shall be heard; for Jehovah has spoiled their pasture,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and the peaceful pastures are cut down because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He has left His den like a lion; for their land is wasted at the presence of His fierce violence, and before His fierce anger.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
