But they shall be as dung on the face of the earth. They shall be destroyed by the sword and by famine; and their carcasses shall be food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For thus says Jehovah, Do not enter into the house of mourning; do not go to weep nor bemoan them. For I have taken away My peace from this people, says Jehovah, even lovingkindness and mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Both the great and the small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried, nor shall men mourn for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nor shall anyone break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead. Nor shall anyone give them the cup of comfort to drink for their father or for their mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also you shall not go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause the voice of mirth to cease out of this place before your eyes, and in your days, and the voice of gladness, and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it shall be, when you proclaim to this people all these words, and they shall say to you, Why has Jehovah pronounced all this great evil against us? Or what is our iniquity, or what is our sin that we have sinned against Jehovah our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then you shall say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken Me, says Jehovah, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have bowed down to them, and have forsaken Me, and have not kept My Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you have done worse than your fathers; for behold, you walk, each one, after the stubbornness of his evil heart, and do not listen to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore I will cast you out of this land into a land that you do not know, neither you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods day and night; where I will not grant you favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that it shall no more be said, As Jehovah lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but rather, As Jehovah lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands where He had driven them. For I will bring them back into their land that I gave to their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I will send for many fishermen, says Jehovah, and they will fish for them. And afterwards I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity hidden from My eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And first I will repay double their iniquity and their sin, because they have defiled My land, they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Jehovah, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the nations shall come to You from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore behold, this once I will make them know; I will cause them to know My hand and My might; and they shall know that My name is Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
