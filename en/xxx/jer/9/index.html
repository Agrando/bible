For they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies. But they are not mighty for the truth on the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not know Me, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Everyone beware of his neighbor, and do not trust any brother! For every brother will supplant and assail his neighbor, and will walk with slanderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And everyone will deceive his neighbor and will not speak the truth; they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and they weary themselves to commit iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know Me, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Behold, I will refine them and try them; for how else shall I deal with the daughter of My people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their tongue is a slaughtering arrow; it speaks deceit; one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he lies in wait.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Shall I not punish them for these things? says Jehovah; shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I will take up a weeping and a wailing for the mountains, and a lamentation for the pastures of the wilderness; because they are burned up, so that no one can pass through them; nor can men hear the voice of the cattle. Both the birds of the heavens and the beasts have fled; they are gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who is the wise man who may understand this? And who is he to whom the mouth of Jehovah has spoken, that he may declare it? Why does the land perish and burn up like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehovah says, Because they have forsaken My Law which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice, and have not walked in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but they have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and make them drink bitter water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will also scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. And I will send a sword after them until I have consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Consider carefully, and call for those who lament, that they may come. And send for the wise women, that they may come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and let them make haste and take up a lamentation for us, so that our eyes may run down with tears, and waters flow from our eyelids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion. How we are plundered! We are greatly ashamed, because we have forsaken the land, because they have thrown down our tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yet hear the Word of Jehovah, O women, and let your ear receive the Word of His mouth, and teach your daughters a mourning song, and each one teach her neighbor a lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For death has come up into our windows, and has entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from outside and the young men from the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Speak, Thus says Jehovah, Even the carcasses of men shall fall as dung on the open field, and as the fallen grain after the reaper; and no one shall gather them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus says Jehovah, Let not the wise glory in his wisdom, nor let the mighty glory in his might; let not the rich glory in his riches;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am Jehovah, doing kindness, justice, and righteousness in the earth; for in these things I delight, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will punish all the circumcised along with the uncircumcised;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all who are in the remotest quarters, who dwell in the wilderness. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
