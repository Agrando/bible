He has made me desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He has bent His bow and set me as a target for the arrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He has caused the arrows of His quiver to enter into my inward parts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I was a laughing stock to all my people;

then I said, I am cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>I called on Your name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>You have heard my voice; do not hide Your ear from my relief, from my cry for help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>You drew near in the day that I called on You; You said, Fear not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>O Lord, You have pleaded the case for my soul; You have redeemed my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>O Jehovah, You have seen how I am wronged; judge my case.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>You have seen all their vengeance, all their plots against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>You have heard their reproach, O Jehovah, all their plots against me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>the lips of those who rose up against me, and their scheming against me all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Behold their sitting down and their rising up; I am their taunting song.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Return upon them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Give them hardness of heart; Your curse be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Pursue and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
