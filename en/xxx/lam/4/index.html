The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The precious sons of Zion, weighed against refined gold, are counted as earthen vessels, the work of the hands of the potter!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Even the monsters draw out the breast to suckle their young. But the daughter of my people is cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The tongue of the infant cleaves to the roof of his mouth in thirst; the young children ask for bread; there is none broken to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets; those brought up in scarlet embrace refuse heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown as in a moment, with no hands to writhe over her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Her Nazirites were purer than snow, whiter than milk; they were redder of body than rubies; their polishing as sapphires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their appearance is blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets; their skin has shriveled on their bones; it is dried up; it has become like wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Better off are the ones slain by the sword than the ones slain by hunger; for they pine away, pierced through for lack of the fruits of the fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The hands of the compassionate women have boiled their own children; they became their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah has fulfilled His fury; He has poured out His fierce anger, and has kindled a fire in Zion, and it has devoured its foundations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy would have entered the gates into Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, shedding the blood of the just in her midst,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>they have wandered as blind men in the streets; they are defiled with blood, so that no one could touch their clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They cried out to them, Depart! Unclean! Depart, depart! Do not touch us! When they fled and wandered, they said among the nations, They will not continue to live there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The face of Jehovah has scattered them out; He will no longer have regard for them; they did not respect the persons of the priests, nor show favor to the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As for us, our eyes failed, watching in vain for our help; in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They have hunted our steps to keep us from going in our streets; our end was near, our days were fulfilled, for our end has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens; they pursued us on the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was captured in their pits; of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, who lives in the land of Uz. The cup also shall pass through unto you; you shall become drunk and stripped naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; He will send you into captivity no more. He will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom; He will expose your sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
