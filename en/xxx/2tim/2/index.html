If we deny Him, He also will deny us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remind them of these things, charging them before the Lord not to argue with empty words to no good, to the destruction of the hearers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will proceed to more ungodliness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection has already come; and they overthrow the faith of some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands firm, having this seal: The Lord knows those who are His, and, Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honor and some for dishonor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But flee youthful lusts; and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But avoid foolish and unlearned questionings, knowing that they generate strife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Besides, a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance unto a full true knowledge of the truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
