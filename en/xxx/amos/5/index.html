And that which goes out by a hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus says Jehovah to the house of Israel, Seek Me, and live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But do not seek Bethel, and do not enter Gilgal, and do not cross over to Beer-sheba; for Gilgal shall be exiled into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Seek Jehovah, and live, that He not break out like a fire on the house of Joseph, and consume it, and there be no one to quench it in Bethel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>you who turn justice into wormwood, and lay righteousness to rest on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns the deep darkness into morning, and darkens the day into night; who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the face of the earth, Jehovah is His name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>who bursts out with destruction on the strong, so that destruction comes on the fortress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They hate him who rebukes in the gate, and they abhor him who speaks uprightly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So, therefore because you trample on the poor, and you take tribute of grain from him; you have built houses of hewn stones, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted desirable vineyards, but you shall not drink wine from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I know your many transgressions, and your many sins: afflicting the just, taking bribes, and thrusting away the poor from justice in the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore the prudent shall keep silent at that time, for it is an evil time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Seek good and not evil, that you may live; and thus Jehovah the God of Hosts shall be with you, as you have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hate evil, and love good, and establish justice in the gate. It may be that Jehovah the God of Hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore Jehovah the God of Hosts, the Lord, says this: There shall be wailing in all the streets, and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! Alas! And they shall call the farmer to the mourning, and those that are skilled in wailing to lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there shall be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass among you, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Woe to those who desire the day of Jehovah! Of what good is this to you? The day of Jehovah is darkness, and not light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is as if a man fled before a lion, and a bear met him. Or he goes into the house and leans his hand against the wall, and a snake bites him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Is not the day of Jehovah darkness, and not light; even very dark, and not any brightness in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I hate, I despise your feast days; and I will not savor your solemn assemblies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Though you offer Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not be pleased; nor will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Take away from Me the noise of your songs; for I will not hear the melody of your lutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But let justice flow down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Have you drawn near with sacrifices and food offerings to Me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Indeed, you have borne the tabernacle of your king, and Chiun your images, the star of your gods, which you made for yourselves!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore I will exile you beyond Damascus, says Jehovah, whose name is God of Hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
