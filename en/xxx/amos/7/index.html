How can Jacob rise up? For he is small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehovah was moved to compassion concerning this: It shall not be, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord Jehovah showed me this: And, behold, the Lord Jehovah called to contend by fire. And it consumed the great deep, and devoured part of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then I said, Lord Jehovah, I beg You, stop. How can Jacob rise up? For he is small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jehovah was moved to compassion concerning this: It shall not be, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He showed me this: And, behold, the Lord stood by a plumb lined wall, with a plumb line in His hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah said to me, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A plumb line. Then the Lord said, Behold, I will set a plumb line in the midst of My people Israel. I will not again pass over him any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the holy places of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to Jeroboam, the king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to endure all his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For thus Amos says: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall be exiled into captivity out of their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Amaziah said to Amos, Seer, go! Flee into the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But do not again prophesy at Bethel any more, for it is the kingÂ’s sanctuary, and it is the royal house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, I was not a prophet, nor was I the son of a prophet, but I was a herdsman and one gathering sycamore fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said to me, Go, prophesy to My people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now, therefore, hear the Word of Jehovah: You say, Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not drop words against the house of Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore thus says Jehovah, Your wife shall be a harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by a survey line. And you shall die in a defiled land. And Israel shall be exiled into captivity from his land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
