For so you love to do, O sons of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places; and you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I have also withheld the rain from you when there were yet three months to the harvest. And I caused rain to fall on one city, and caused it not to rain on another city. One parcel of land was rained on, and the parcel where it did not rain was dried up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So two or three cities staggered to one city in order to drink water, but they were not satisfied; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I have struck you with blasting and mildew. When your gardens and your vineyards, and your figs, and your olives increased, the locust devoured them; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have sent a plague among you in the manner of Egypt; I have killed your young men with the sword, along with your captive horses. And I have made the stench of your camps come up into your nostrils; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a firebrand plucked out of the burning; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I will do this to you, O Israel: Because of this that I will do to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For, behold, He who forms mountains and creates the wind and declares to man what his thought is, He who makes the dawn darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth; Jehovah the God of Hosts, is His name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
