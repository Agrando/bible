And I said, A basket of summer fruit. And Jehovah said to me, The end has come upon My people Israel; I will not again pass over him any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the songs of the temple will be howling in that day, declares the Lord Jehovah. Many dead bodies everywhere; and they shall throw them out in silence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hear this, you who swallow up the needy, and make the poor of the land to fail,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>saying, When will the new moon have passed, so that we may buy grain? Or the sabbath, so that we may open the wheat; making the ephah smaller, and making the shekel greater, and falsifying the balances by deceit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>in order to buy the poor with silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals, and sell the refuse of the wheat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jehovah has sworn by the Pride of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Shall not the land tremble for this, and everyone who dwells in it mourn? And all of it shall rise like the light, and it shall overflow and sink like the river of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall be in that day, declares the Lord Jehovah, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the light of day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation. And I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head. And I will make it like the mourning for an only one; and the end of it like a bitter day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord Jehovah, that I will send a famine into the land, not a famine for bread, nor a thirst for water, but rather a famine for hearing the Words of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall roam to and fro to seek the Word of Jehovah, and they shall not find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In that day the beautiful virgins and the young men shall faint with thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They who swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, As your god lives, O Dan! and, As the way of Beer-sheba lives! even they shall fall, and never rise again.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
