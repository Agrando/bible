Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Can two walk together except they are agreed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Will a lion roar in the forest when there is no prey for him? Will a young lion cry out of his den unless he has caught something?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Will a bird fall into a trap on the ground, where there is no bait for it? Will a trap spring up from the ground, and it has caught nothing at all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If a shofar is blown in a city, will the people not also tremble? If there is calamity in a city, will not even Jehovah have done it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>A lion has roared! Who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah has spoken! Who can but prophesy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Proclaim in the palaces in Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Gather yourselves on the mountains of Samaria and see great tumults in its midst, and oppressions in its midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they do not know to do right, declares Jehovah, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore the Lord Jehovah says this: An enemy shall be all around the land. And he shall bring down your strength from you, and your fortresses shall be plundered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus says Jehovah, As the shepherd snatches two legs out of the mouth of the lion, or a piece of an ear, so shall the sons of Israel be snatched, those who dwell in Samaria in a corner of a bed, and in Damascus on a couch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hear and testify in the house of Jacob, declares the Lord Jehovah the God of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For in the day that I punish the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also attend to the altars of Bethel. And the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will strike the winter house along with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall come to an end, declares Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
