And He said, Strike the capital of the door, and the thresholds will shake; and cut them off on the head of all of them. And I will kill the last of them with the sword. Not one of them who flees will get away, and not a fugitive of them will escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Even if they dig through into Sheol, from there My hand will take them. And if they ascend up to the heavens, from there I will bring them down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out from there. Even if they hide from My eyes in the bottom of the sea, from there I will command the serpent, and he will bite them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And though they go into captivity before their enemies, from there I will command the sword, and it will kill them. And I will set My eyes on them for evil, and not for good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Lord Jehovah of Hosts is He who touches the earth so that it melts, and all who dwell in it shall mourn. And all of it will rise up like the River, and sink down like the River of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who builds His stairs in the heavens, and His firmament He has established, binding it to the earth; He who calls for the seawaters and pours them out on the face of the earth; Jehovah is His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Are you not like the sons of Cush to Me, O sons of Israel? declares Jehovah. Have I not brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth; except that, I will not utterly annihilate the house of Jacob, declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, behold, I will command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations, as one sifts with a sieve; yet not a grain shall fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword, those who say, The evil shall not draw near or come upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In that day I will raise up the covert of David that has fallen, and I will wall up its breaks. And I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by My name, declares Jehovah who does this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, the days are coming, declares Jehovah, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him who drags along seed. And the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and all the hills will flow with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will bring back the captives of My people Israel. And they shall build the waste cities, and live in them. And they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them. They shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall never again be pulled up out of their land which I have given to them, says Jehovah your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
