Behold, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore wash yourself and anoint yourself, dress up and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies; and you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lie down; and he will tell you what you shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she said to her, All that you say to me I will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had charged her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And after Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was glad, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it happened at midnight that the man was startled, and turned himself; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Who are you? So she answered, I am Ruth, your maidservant. Spread your skirt over your maidservant, for you are a kinsman redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Blessed are you of Jehovah, my daughter! For you have shown more kindness at the end than at the beginning, in that you did not go after young men, whether poor or rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you speak, for all the people of my town know that you are a woman of strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now it is true that I am a kinsman redeemer; however, there is a kinsman redeemer closer than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Stay this night, and in the morning it shall be that if he will redeem you, good, let him do it. But if he does not want to redeem you, then I will be your kinsman redeemer, as Jehovah lives! Lie down until morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So she lay at his feet until morning, and she arose before one could recognize another. And he said, Do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, Bring the shawl that is on you and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six ephahs of barley, and laid it on her. And she went into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Is that you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she said, These six ephahs of barley he gave me; for he said to me, Do not go empty to your mother-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then she said, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will turn out; for the man will not rest until he has concluded the matter this day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
