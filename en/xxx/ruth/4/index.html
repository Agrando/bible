So he said, Ho there, you! Turn aside and sit down here. So he came aside and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit down here. And they sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said to the kinsman redeemer, Naomi, who has come back from the land of Moab, has sold the piece of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I thought to uncover your ear to say, Buy it in the presence of the inhabitants and the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you. And he said, I will redeem it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Boaz said, On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also buy it from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the kinsman redeemer said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. You redeem my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot redeem it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging, to establish anything: one man took off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was an attestation in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore the kinsman redeemer said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself; and he drew off his sandal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelechs, and all that was Chilions and Mahlons, from the hand of Naomi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have acquired as my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from his position at the gate. You are witnesses this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Jehovah make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, the two who built the house of Israel; and may you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>May your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the seed which Jehovah shall give to you from this young woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and when he went in to her, Jehovah gave her conception, and she bore a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the women said to Naomi, Blessed is Jehovah, who has not left you this day without a kinsman redeemer; and may his name be famous in Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And may he be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Naomi took the child and laid him on her bosom, and nursed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also the neighbor women gave him a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi. And they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
