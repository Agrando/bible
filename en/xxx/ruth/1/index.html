And a certain man of Bethlehem, Judah, went to dwell in the land of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The name of the man was Elimelech, the name of his wife was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion; Ephrathites of Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to the land of Moab and remained there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Elimelech, Naomis husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they took wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; so the woman survived her two children and her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the land of Moab, for she had heard in the land of Moab that Jehovah had visited His people by giving them bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore she went out from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to her mothers house. Jehovah deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jehovah grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband. And she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they said to her, Surely we will return with you to your people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Naomi said, Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? Are there yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Turn back, my daughters, go; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, if I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>would you wait for them till they were grown? Would you restrain yourselves from having husbands? No, my daughters; for it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of Jehovah has gone out against me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said, Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Ruth said: Entreat me not to leave you, or to turn back from following after you; for wherever you go, I will go; and wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God, my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Where you die, I will die, and there will I be buried. Jehovah do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts you and me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the two of them went until they came to Bethlehem. And it happened, when they had come to Bethlehem, that all the city was in a stir because of them; and they said, Is this Naomi?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she said to them, Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I went out full, and Jehovah has brought me back home empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since Jehovah has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the land of Moab. Now they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
