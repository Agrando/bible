His name was Boaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Please let me go to the fields, and glean heads of grain after him in whose eyes I may find favor. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to the part of the fields belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, Jehovah be with you! And they answered him, Jehovah bless you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Boaz said to his servant who was appointed over the reapers, Whose young woman is this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the servant who was appointed over the reapers answered and said, It is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the land of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she said, Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came and has continued from morning until now, though she sat a little in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Boaz said to Ruth, You will listen, my daughter, will you not? Do not go to glean in another field, nor go from here, but stay close by my young women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Have I not commanded the young men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink from what the young men have drawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she fell on her face, bowed down to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Boaz answered and said to her, It has been fully reported to me, all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and have come to a people whom you have not known before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>May Jehovah reward your work, and full wages be given you by Jehovah the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And she said, Let me find favor in your eyes, my lord; for you have comforted me, and have spoken to the heart of your maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Boaz said to her at mealtime, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar. So she sat beside the reapers, and he held out parched grain to her; and she ate and was satisfied, and had some left over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when she rose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also let grain from the bundles fall purposely for her; leave it that she may glean, and do not rebuke her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. And she brought out and gave to her what had been left over after she had been satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? And where have you worked? Blessed is the one taking notice of you. So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed is he of Jehovah, who has not forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead! And Naomi said to her, This man is next of kin to us, a kinsman redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ruth the Moabitess said, He also said to me, You shall stay close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, and that you not be fallen upon in another field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz, to glean until the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
