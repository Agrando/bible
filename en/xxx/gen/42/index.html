Go down to that place and buy for us from there, that we may live and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Josephs ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jacob did not send Josephs brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he thought, Lest he encounter some harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of Israel went to buy grain among those who journeyed, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joseph was lord over the land; and it was he who sold to all the people of the land. And Josephs brothers came and bowed down before him, their faces to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted as a stranger to them and spoke harshly to them, and he said to them, Where have you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them, and said to them, You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they said to him, No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We are all sons of one man; we are honest; your servants are not spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to them, No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they said, Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and lo, the youngest is with our father today, and one is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph said to them, It is as I have spoken to you, saying, You are spies!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In this manner you shall be tested: By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Send one of you, and let him bring your brother; and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proven to see whether there is any truth in you; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he put them all together in prison three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph said to them the third day, Do this and live, for I fear God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you are honest, let one of your brothers be confined to your prison house; but you, go and carry grain for the famine of your houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And bring your youngest brother to me; so your words will be verified, and you shall not die. And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said to one another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother, for we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us, and we would not listen; therefore this distress has come upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the boy; and you would not listen? Therefore behold, his blood is now required of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they did not know that Joseph understood them, for he spoke to them through an interpreter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he turned himself away from them and wept, and returned to them again, and talked with them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with grain, to restore every mans money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. Thus he did for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey feed at the lodging, he saw his money; and behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to his brothers, My money has been restored, and lo, it is in my sack! And their hearts failed them and they were afraid, saying to one another, What is this that God has done to us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they went to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that had befallen them, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man who is lord of the land spoke harshly to us, and took us for spies in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And we said to him, We are honest; we are not spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is with our father this day in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, By this I will know that you are honest: Leave one of your brothers here with me, take food for the famine of your houses, and go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And bring your youngest brother to me; so I shall know that you are not spies, but that you are honest. I will give your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it happened as they emptied their sacks, that behold, each mans bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jacob their father said to them, You have bereaved me: Joseph is not, Simeon is not, and you would take Benjamin. All these things are against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you; put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he said, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. If any harm should befall him along the way in which you go, then you would bring down my gray hair in sorrow to Sheol.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
