And if he said thus: The streaked shall be your wages, then all the flocks bore streaked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it happened, at the time when the flocks were in heat, that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which mounted the flocks were streaked, speckled, and spotted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, Jacob. And I said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He said, Lift up your eyes now and see, all the rams which mount the flocks are streaked, speckled, and spotted; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and where you vowed a vow to Me. Now arise, get out of this land, and return to the land of your kindred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Are we not considered foreigners by him? For he has sold us, and also devoured and consumed our money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For all these riches which God has taken from our father are ours and our sons. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he drove away all his livestock and all his possessions which he had gained, his acquired livestock which he had gained in Paddan, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel had stolen the household idols that were her fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob stole away, unknown to Laban the Aramean, in that he did not tell him that he was fleeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he fled with all that he had. He arose and crossed the river, and set his face toward the mountains of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took his brethren with him and pursued him for seven days journey, and he overtook him in the mountains of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And God come to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night, and said to him, Beware that you not speak to Jacob from good to evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountains, and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountains of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said to Jacob: What have you done, that you have stolen away unknown to me, and led away my daughters like captives of the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and not tell me; for I might have sent you away with joy and songs, with timbrel and harp?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters. Now you have done foolishly in so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>It is in the power of my hand to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Beware that you not speak to Jacob from good to evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And now you have proceeded to depart because you have longed for your fathers house. But why have you stolen my gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Lest you would take your daughters from me by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>With whomever you find your gods, do not let him live. In the presence of our brethren, identify what I have of yours and take it with you. For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Laban went into Jacobs tent, into Leahs tent, and into the two maidservants tents, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leahs tent and entered Rachels tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now Rachel had taken the household idols, put them in the camels saddle, and sat on them. And Laban groped all about the tent but did not find them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she said to her father, Let it not burn in the eyes of my lord that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is with me. And he searched but did not find the household idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jacob was furious and complained to Laban, and Jacob answered and said to Laban: What is my transgression? What is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Although you have searched all my things, what of your household articles have you found? Set it here before my brethren and your brethren, that they may judge between us both!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried their young, and I have not eaten the rams of your flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it. You required it from my hand, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There I was: In the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thus I have been in your house twenty years; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, and rebuked you last night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Laban answered and said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks; all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now therefore, come, let us make a covenant, you and me, and let it be a witness between you and me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a monument.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones. And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there on the heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Laban said, This heap is a witness between you and me this day. Therefore its name was called Galeed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>also, Mizpah; because he said, May Jehovah watch between you and me when we are hidden (being absent) one from another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>If you afflict my daughters, or if you take other wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us; consider that God is witness between you and me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap and this pillar, which I have cast between me and you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a testimony, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you, and you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, for evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, and the God of their father judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Jacob slaughtered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread. And they ate bread and stayed all night on the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and daughters and blessed them. And Laban departed and returned to his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
