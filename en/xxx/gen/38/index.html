He was at Chezib when she bore him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Er, Judahs firstborn, was evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and Jehovah killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brothers wife and marry her, and raise up seed to your brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Onan knew that the heir would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brothers wife, that he spoiled it on the ground, so as not to give seed to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the thing which he did made the eye of Jehovah quiver; therefore He killed him also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in your fathers house till my son Shelah is grown. For he thought, Lest he also die like his brothers. And Tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now in the process of time the daughter of Shua, Judahs wife, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she took off her widows garments, covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place which was on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, because she had veiled her face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he turned aside to her by the way, and said, Please let me come in to you; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. So she said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, I will send a young goat from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge till you send it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, What pledge shall I give you? So she said, Your signet ring and cord, and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So she arose and went away, and laid aside her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the womans hand, but he did not find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot who was openly by the wayside? And they said, There was no harlot here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So he returned to Judah and said, I have not found her. Also, the men of the place said there was no harlot there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Judah said, Let her take them for herself, that we not be held in contempt; for I sent this young goat and you have not found her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, after about three months, that Judah was told, saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; furthermore she is with child by prostitution. So Judah said, Bring her out and let her be burned!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man to whom these belong, I am with child. And she said, Please acknowledge whose these are; the signet ring and cord, and staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Judah acknowledged them and said, She has been more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he never knew her again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, at the time for giving birth, that behold, twins were in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And so it was, when she was giving birth, that the one put out his hand; and the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his hand, saying, This one came out first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it happened, as he drew back his hand, that his brother came forth; and she said, How have you broken through this breach for yourself? Therefore his name was called Perez.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And afterward out came his brother who had the scarlet thread on his hand. And his name was called Zerah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
