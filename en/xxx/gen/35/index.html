So the name of it was called Allon Bachuth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came out of Paddan, and blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And God said to him, Your name is Jacob; your name shall not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel shall be your name. And He called his name Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>God also said to him: I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall proceed from you, and kings shall come forth from your loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I give to you; and to your seed after you I give this land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And God ascended from him in the place where He had spoken with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they journeyed from Bethel. And when there was still some ground to cover to arrive at Ephrath, Rachel was giving birth, and she had hard labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Do not fear; you shall have this son also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And so it was, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-Oni; but his father called him Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (which is Bethlehem).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jacob set a pillar on her grave, which is the pillar of Rachels grave to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Israel journeyed and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it happened, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his fathers concubine; and Israel heard about it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>the sons of Leah were Reuben, Jacobs firstborn, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the sons of Bilhah, Rachels maidservant, were Dan and Naphtali;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and the sons of Zilpah, Leahs maidservant, were Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, to the city of Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and fulfilled in days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
