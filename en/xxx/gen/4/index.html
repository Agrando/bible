And Abel tended flocks, but Cain worked the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And at the end of so many days it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And Jehovah had regard for Abel and his offering,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but He did not have regard for Cain and his offering. And Cains anger burned greatly, and his countenance fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Jehovah said to Cain, Why does your anger burn? And why has your countenance fallen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you do well, is there not exaltation? And if you do not do well, sin is lying at the door. And its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? He said, I do not know. Am I my brothers keeper?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He said, What have you done? The voice of your brothers blood cries out to Me from the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood from your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; I shall be hidden from Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, and it will happen that anyone who finds me will kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jehovah said to him, Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken upon him sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain, so that anyone finding him should not kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son: Enoch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Lamech took for himself two wives: the name of one was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Adah bore Jabal: He was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His brothers name was Jubal: He was the father of all those who play the harp and flute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And as for Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain: One hammering in every craft of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah: Hear my voice, you wives of Lamech, listen to my speech! For I have killed a man for wounding me, even a young man for striking me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the man knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name: Seth, for God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel; because Cain killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as for Seth, to him also a son was born; and he called his name Enosh. Then they began to call upon the name of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
