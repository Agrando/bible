And he answered him, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he said, Behold now, I am old. I do not know the day of my death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt game and to bring it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Bring me game and make savory food for me, that I may eat it and bless you in the presence of Jehovah before my death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to what I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Go now to the flock and bring me from there two choice kids of the goats, and I will make savory food from them for your father, such as he loves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall take it to your father, that he may eat it, and that he may bless you before his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be a deceiver to him; and I shall bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And his mother said to him, Let your curse be upon me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get them for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Rebekah took the good clothes of her elder son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he went in to his father and said, My father. And he said, Here am I. Who are you, my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your firstborn; I have done just as you have spoken to me; please arise, sit and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah your God brought it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Isaac said to Jacob, Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are my very son Esau or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jacob went near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, The voice is Jacobs voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esaus hands; so he blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said, Are you really my son Esau? And he said, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my sons game, so that my soul may bless you. So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now and kiss me, my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him and said: Surely, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field which Jehovah has blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, God give you of the dew of the heavens, of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of grain and wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let nations serve you, and people bow down to you. Be lord over your brethren, and let your mothers sons bow down to you. Cursed is everyone who curses you, and blessed be those who bless you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he also had made savory food, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, Let my father arise and eat of his sons game, that your soul may bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And his father Isaac said to him, Who are you? So he said, I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Isaac trembled with a very great trembling, and said, Who? Where is the one who hunted game and brought it to me? I ate all of it before you came, and I have blessed him; and moreover, he shall be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me; me also, O my father!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said, Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Esau said, Is he not rightly called by the name Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright, and now behold, he has taken away my blessing! And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brethren I have given to him as servants; with grain and wine I have sustained him. What shall I do now for you, my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Esau said to his father, Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me; me also, O my father! And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Isaac his father answered and said to him: Behold, your dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of the heavens from above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass, when you become restless, that you shall break his yoke from your neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and summoned Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself concerning you by intending to kill you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: arise, flee to my brother Laban, to Haran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And stay with him some days, until your brothers fury turns away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>until your brothers anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereaved also of you both in one day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, like these daughters of the land, what kind of life is that to me?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
