And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is married to a husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, Lord, will You slay a righteous nation also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Did he not say to me, She is my sister? And she, even she herself said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And God said to him in a dream, Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore, restore the mans wife; for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall die the death, you and all who are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Abimelech rose early in the morning, summoned all his servants, and told all these things in their ears; and the men were greatly afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him, What have you done to us? How have I offended you, that you have brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abimelech said to Abraham, What did you see, that you have done this thing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will kill me on account of my wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And yet she is truly my sister. She is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my fathers house, that I said to her, This is your kindness which you shall do for me: in every place, wherever we go, say of me, He is my brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Abimelech took sheep, oxen, and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham; and he restored Sarah his wife to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; indeed this vindicates you before all who are with you and before everybody. Thus she was rebuked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants. Then they gave birth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for Jehovah had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, the wife of Abraham.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
