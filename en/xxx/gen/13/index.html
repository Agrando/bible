And there Abram called upon the name of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the land was not able to support them, that they might dwell together, for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abrams livestock and the herdsmen of Lots livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites then dwelt in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abram said to Lot, Please let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we men are brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me. If you take the left, then I will go to the right; or, if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the area around Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere (before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt as you go toward Zoar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Lot chose for himself all the area around Jordan, and Lot journeyed east. And they separated each from the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt around the cities, and pitched his tent even as far as Sodom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the men of Sodom were exceedingly evil and sinful before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And after Lot had separated from him, Jehovah said to Abram: Lift up your eyes now and look from the place where you are, northward, southward, eastward, and westward;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for all the land which you see I give to you and your seed in perpetuity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth; so that if a man could count the dust of the earth, then your seed also could be numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Arise, walk in the land through its length and its width, for I give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Abram moved his tent, and went and dwelt by the plain of Mamre in Hebron, and built an altar there unto Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
