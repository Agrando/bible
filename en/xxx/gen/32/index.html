And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Jacob sent messengers before his face to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the land of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he commanded them, saying, Speak thus to my lord Esau, Thus your servant Jacob says: I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and he also is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he thought, If Esau comes to the one company and strikes it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, Jehovah who said to me, Return to your land and to your kindred, and I will deal well with you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the faithfulness which You have done for Your servant; for I crossed over this Jordan with my staff, and now I have become two companies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Rescue me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers to the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For You said, I will do good to deal well with you, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he lodged there that night, and took what came to his hand as a present for Esau his brother:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put some space from drove to drove.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he commanded the first one, saying, When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, To whom do you belong, and where are you going? Whose are these before you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>then you shall say, They are your servant Jacobs. It is a present sent to my lord Esau; and behold, he also is behind us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he commanded the second, the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, You shall speak these words to Esau when you find him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and also say, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he thought, I will propitiate before his face with the present that goes before me, and afterward when I shall see his face, perhaps he will forgive me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the present passed over before him, but he himself remained that night in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he arose that night and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of Jabbok.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He took them, sent them over the brook, and sent over what he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the dawn began to rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when He saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacobs hip was out of joint as He wrestled with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And He said, Let Me go, for the dawn has risen. But he said, I will not let You go unless You bless me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And He said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And He said, Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have persevered with God and with men, and have prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jacob asked, saying, Please tell me Your name. And He said, Why is it that you ask about My name? And He blessed him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jacob called the name of the place Penuel: For I have seen God face to face, and my soul is delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Just as he crossed over Penuel the sun rose over him, and he was limping on his thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore to this day the children of Israel do not eat the muscle tendon which is on the hip socket, because He touched the socket of Jacobs hip on the muscle tendon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
