After that you may pass on, for this is why you have passed along by your servant. They said, Do as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, Quickly, make ready three measures of fine meal; knead it and make cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Abraham ran to the herd, took a tender and good calf, gave it to a young man, and he hastened to prepare it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took butter and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree. And they ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? So he said, Here, in the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He said, I will come back to return to you according to the time of life, and behold, Sarah your wife shall have a son. And Sarah was listening from the tent opening which was behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age; and it had ceased to be after the manner of women with Sarah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, Being worn out, shall I be delighted, my lord, having also become old?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehovah said to Abraham, Why has Sarah laughed, saying, Shall I surely give birth, I who have become old?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is anything beyond the power of Jehovah? At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Sarah denied it, saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid. And He said, No, but you did laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the men rose up from there and looked toward Sodom, and Abraham went with them to send them on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>since Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I have known him, in order that he may command his children and his house after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice, that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and their sin is exceedingly heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry against it that has come to Me; and if not, I will know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Abraham approached and said, Would You also sweep away the righteous with the wicked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city; would You also destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous that were in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I who am but dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous; would You destroy all of the city for lack of five? And He said, If I find forty-five there, I will not destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he spoke to Him yet again and said, Suppose there should be forty found there? And He said, I will not do it for the sake of forty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he said, Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Suppose thirty should be found there? And He said, I will not do it if I find thirty there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: Suppose twenty should be found there? And He said, I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said, Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak but once more: Suppose ten should be found there? And He said, I will not destroy it for the sake of ten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Jehovah went His way as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
