They have been entrusted into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have designated all things for you, even as the green plants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But you shall not eat flesh with its soul, that is, its blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Surely the blood of your souls will I require; at the hand of every living thing will I require it, and at the hand of man. At the hand of every mans brother I will require the soul of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whoever sheds mans blood, by man his blood shall be shed; for in the image of God He made man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as for you, be fruitful and multiply; swarm in the earth and multiply in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as for Me, behold, I establish My covenant with you and with your seed after you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and with every living creature that is with you: the flying creatures, the animals, and every living thing of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ark, every living thing of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus I have established My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God said, This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look upon it to remember the perpetual covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham was the father of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>These three were the sons of Noah, and from these they scattered throughout the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Noah began to be a man of the land, and he planted a vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he drank of the wine and was drunk, and was uncovered in his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backward, and they did not see the nakedness of their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Noah awoke from his wine, and perceived what his younger son had done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said: Cursed is Canaan; a servant of servants he shall be to his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said: Blessed is Jehovah the God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
