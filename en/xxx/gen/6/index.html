And also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them, these were the mighty men from antiquity, men of renown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehovah saw that the evil of man was great on the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all day long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jehovah regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved to His heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehovah said, I will obliterate man whom I have created from off the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and flying creatures of the heavens, for I regret having made them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect in his generation. Noah walked with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them along with the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Make yourself an ark of gopherwood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit from above; and set the door of the ark in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And behold I, even I, am bringing a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy from under the heavens all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall go into the ark; you, your sons, your wife, and your sonsÂ’ wives with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And of every living thing of all flesh you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Of flying creatures after their kind, of animals after their kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every kind will come in to you, to keep them alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And take for yourself of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it shall be food for you and for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus Noah did; according to all that God commanded him, so he did.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
