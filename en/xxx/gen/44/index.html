So he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As soon as the morning had dawned, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Arise and pursue the men; and when you have overtaken them, say to them, Why have you repaid evil for good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not this the one from which my lord drinks, and with which he indeed practices divination? You have done evil in so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said to him, Why does my lord say these words? Far be it from us that your servants should do such a thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lords house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lords slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Now also let it be according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and you shall be innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And each man hastened to let down his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he searched. He began with the oldest and finished with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamins sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey and returned to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah and his brothers came to Josephs house, and he was still there; and they prostrated before him on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joseph said to them, What deed is this you have done? Did you not know that such a man as I can certainly practice divination?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants; behold, we are my lords slaves, both we and he also with whom the cup was found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the cup was found, he shall be my slave. And as for you, go up in peace to your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Judah came near to him and said: O my lord, please let your servant speak a word in the ears of my lord, and do not let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you a father or a brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, who is young; his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you said to your servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But you said to your servants, Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, when we went up to your servant my father, that we told him the words of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And our father said, Go back and buy us a little food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And we said, We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we may not see the mans face unless our youngest brother is with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And your servant my father said to us, You know that my wife bore me two sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn to pieces; and I have not seen him since.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if you take this one also from before me, and harm befalls him, you shall bring down my gray hair with sorrow to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his soul is bound up in the lads soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>it shall come to pass, when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die. So your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the guilt before my father for all time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the lad as a slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For how shall I go up to my father if the lad is not with me, lest perhaps I see the evil that would come upon my father?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
