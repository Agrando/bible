Therefore she called his name Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Rachels maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Rachel said, With great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed. So she called his name Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when Leah saw that she had stopped giving birth, she took Zilpah her maid and gave her to Jacob as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Leahs maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Leah said, Good fortune has come! So she called his name Gad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Leahs maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Leah said, I am happy, for the daughters shall call me blessed. So she called his name Asher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. And Rachel said to Leah, Please give me some of your sons mandrakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said to her, Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my sons mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your sons mandrakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When Jacob came out of the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, You must come in to me, for hiring I have hired you with my sons mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God gave heed to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Leah said, God has given me my wages, because I have given my maid to my husband. So she called his name Issachar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Leah said, God has endowed me with a good endowment; this time my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons. So she called his name Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And afterward she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And God remembered Rachel, and God gave heed to her and opened her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And she conceived and bore a son, and said, God has taken away my reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So she called his name Joseph, and said, Jehovah shall add to me another son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Laban said to him, Please stay, if I have found favor in your eyes, for I have observed the signs that Jehovah has blessed me because of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said, Specify your wages to me, and I will give it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So Jacob said to him, You know how I have served you and how your livestock is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For what you had before I came was little, and it has increased into a multitude; Jehovah has blessed you since I stepped foot here. And now, when shall I also provide for my own house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will turn back to feed and keep your flocks:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and these shall be my wages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So my righteousness shall testify for me in time to come, when the subject of my wages comes before you: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the lambs, will be considered stolen, if it is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Laban said, Oh, that it were according to your word!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So he removed that day the male goats that were speckled and spotted, all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had some white in it, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and gave them into the hand of his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he put three days journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Labans flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jacob took for himself rods of green poplar and of the almond and plane trees, peeled white strips in them, and laid bare the white which was in the rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the rods which he had peeled, he set before the flocks in the troughs, in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, so that they should come into heat when they came to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the flocks mated before the rods, and the flocks gave birth to streaked, speckled, and spotted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the brown in the flock of Laban; but he put his own flocks by themselves and did not put them with Labans flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass, whenever the stronger livestock were in heat, that Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the livestock in the troughs, that they might mate among the rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when the flocks were feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Labans and the stronger Jacobs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the man increased exceedingly greatly, and had many cattle, female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
