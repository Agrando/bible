So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he crossed over in front of them and prostrated himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children, and said, Who are these with you? And he said, The children whom God has graciously given your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the maidservants came near, they and their children, and bowed down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward Joseph and Rachel came near, and they bowed down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Esau said, What do you mean by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the eyes of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Esau said, I have abundance, my brother; keep what you have to yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jacob said, No, please, if I have now found favor in your eyes, then receive my present from my hand, inasmuch as I have seen your face as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Please, take my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have everything I need. So he urged him, and he took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Esau said, Let us take our journey; let us go, and I will go before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Jacob said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds which are nursing are with me. And if the men should drive them hard one day, all the flock will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Please let my lord go on ahead before his servant. I will lead on gently according to the pace of the livestock that go before me, and the feet of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Esau said, Now let me leave with you some of the people who are with me. But he said, What need is there? Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, built himself a house, and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan; and he pitched his tent before the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he bought the parcel of land where he had pitched his tent, from the hand of the sons of Hamor, ShechemÂ’s father, for one hundred pieces of money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he set up an altar there, and called it, El Elohe Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
