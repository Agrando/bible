And he said to the woman, Has God indeed said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be as God, knowing good and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they heard the sound of Jehovah God walking around in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God among the trees of the garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah God called to the man and said to him, Where are you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And He said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the man said, The woman whom You gave to be with me, she has given to me of the tree, and I ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehovah God said to the woman, What is this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Jehovah God said to the serpent: Because you have done this, you are cursed more than all beasts, and more than every living thing of the field; on your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To the woman He said: I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in pain you shall bring forth children; your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And to Adam He said, Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: Cursed is the ground for your sake; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the plants of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you have been taken; for dust you are, and to dust you shall return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the man called his wifeÂ’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also for the man and his wife Jehovah God made tunics of skins, and clothed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man has become as one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, that he not put forth his hand and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>therefore Jehovah God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the Garden of Eden, and a flaming sword turning this way and that, to guard the way to the Tree of Life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
