And he said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And He said, Take now your son, your only one Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Abraham said to his young men, Stay here with the donkey; and the lad and I will go over there and do homage, and we will come back to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, My father. And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abraham said, My son, God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering. So the two of them went together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens and said, Abraham! Abraham! And he said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He said, Do not lay your hand upon the lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only one from Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and there behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Abraham called the name of the place, Jehovah Jireh; as it is said to this day, In the Mount of Jehovah it shall be seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham a second time out of the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and said: By Myself I have sworn, says Jehovah, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that in blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore. And your Seed shall possess the gate of His enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in your Seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, AbrahamÂ’s brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
