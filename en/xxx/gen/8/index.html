And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were also stopped, and the rain from the heavens was restrained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the waters receded from the earth, going out and coming back. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were decreased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the ark rested in the seventh month, the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the waters continued to go and decrease until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from off the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from off the face of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned into the ark to him, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her, and drew her into the ark to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent the dove out from the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the dove came to him in the evening, and behold, a freshly plucked olive leaf was in her mouth; so Noah knew that the waters had receded from off the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So he waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove, which did not return again to him anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, that the waters were dried up from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was dry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And God spoke to Noah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons wives with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you: flying creatures and animals and every creeping thing that moves on the earth, so that they may swarm on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every living thing, every creeping thing, every flying creature, and everything that moves on the earth, according to their kind, went out of the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Noah built an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah smelled a soothing aroma. And Jehovah said in His heart, I will never again curse the ground because of man, although the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth; nor will I again smite every living thing as I have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
