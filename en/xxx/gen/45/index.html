So no one stood with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he wept aloud, and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph; is my father still alive? But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Joseph said to his brothers, Please come near to me. So they came near. And he said: I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now, do not therefore be grieved or angry in your eyes because you sold me here; for God has sent me before you to preserve life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And God sent me before you to preserve you as a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So now it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus says your son Joseph: God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you and your children, your childrens children, your flocks and your herds, and all that you have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will nourish you there, so that you and your house, and all that you have, not come to poverty; for there are yet five years of famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And behold, your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth that is speaking to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen; and you shall hurry and bring my father down here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he fell on the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover he kissed all his brothers and wept over them, and after that his brothers talked with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the report of it was heard in Pharaohs house, saying, Josephs brothers have come. And it was well pleasing in the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, Do this: Load your animals and depart; go to the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And bring your father and your households and come to me; I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now you are commanded; do this: Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives; bring your father and come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Also do not be concerned about your goods, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the mouth of Pharaoh, and he gave them provisions for the journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He gave to all of them, to each man, changes of garments; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he sent to his father these things: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and food for his father for the journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So he sent his brothers away, and they departed; and he said to them, See that you do not become perturbed along the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they went up out of Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they told him, saying, Joseph is still alive, and he is ruling over all the land of Egypt. And his heart became numb, for he did not believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when they told him all the words which Joseph had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Israel said, It is enough! Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
