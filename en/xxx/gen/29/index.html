And a large stone was on the wells mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And all the flocks would be gathered there; and they would roll the stone from the wells mouth, water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the wells mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jacob said to them, My brethren, where are you from? And they said, We are from Haran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to them, Do you know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well. And behold, his daughter Rachel is coming with the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said, Behold, it is still high day; it is not the time for cattle to be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they said, We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they have rolled the stone from the wells mouth; then we water the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And while he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her fathers sheep, for she was tending them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mothers brother, and the sheep of Laban his mothers brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mothers brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her fathers relative and that he was Rebekahs son. So she ran and told her father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when Laban heard the report about Jacob his sisters son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. So he told Laban all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he stayed with him a month of days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Leahs eyes were delicate, but Rachel had a beautiful figure and a beautiful appearance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Laban said, It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they were only a day in his eyes because of the love he had for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my days have been fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him; and he went in to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a maidservant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served you? Why then have you deceived me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Laban said, It is not done so in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Fulfill her week, and we will give you this one also for the service which you will serve with me yet another seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jacob did so and fulfilled her week. So he gave him his daughter Rachel as wife also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as a maidservant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jacob also went in to Rachel, and he also loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served with him yet another seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, Jehovah has surely looked upon my affliction. Now therefore, my husband will love me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, Because Jehovah has heard that I am hated, He has therefore given me this one also. And she called his name Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore his name was called Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, Now I will praise Jehovah. Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she stopped giving birth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
