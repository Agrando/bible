And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brothers son, and all their possessions that they had collected, and the souls they had acquired in Haran, and they departed to go into the land of Canaan. So they came into the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanites were then in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehovah appeared to Abram and said, To your seed I will give this land. And there he built an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he moved from there to the mountain east of Bethel, and he pitched his tent with Bethel toward the sea and Ai on the east. There he built an altar unto Jehovah and called upon the name of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Abram journeyed, proceeding to journey toward the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was heavy in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, when he was close to entering Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, This is his wife; and they will kill me, but they will let you live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and my soul shall live because of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass when Abram came into Egypt, that the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The princes of Pharaoh also saw her and commended her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaohs house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He dealt well with Abram because of her; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male and female servants, female donkeys, and camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jehovah struck Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of the matter of Sarai, Abrams wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Pharaoh summoned Abram and said, What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why did you say, She is my sister? And so I took her to be my wife. Now therefore, here is your wife; take her and depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him; and they sent him away, with his wife and all that he had.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
