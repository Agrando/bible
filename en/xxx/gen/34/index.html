Now his sons were with his livestock in the field; so Jacob held his peace until they came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved and extremely furious, because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacobs daughter, a thing which ought not to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Hamor spoke with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall dwell with us, and the land is before you. Dwell and trade in it, and acquire possessions in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Shechem said to her father and her brothers, Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Ask me ever so much dowry and gift, and I will give according to what you say to me; but give me the girl as a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, and spoke deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and they said to them: We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for that would be a reproach to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But on this condition we will consent to you: If you will become as we are, if every male of you is circumcised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us; and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if you will not heed us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and be gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamors son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacobs daughter. He was more honorable than all the house of his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>These men are peaceable with us. Therefore let them dwell in the land and trade in it. For indeed the land is wide of hands before them. Let us take their daughters to us as wives, and let us give our daughters to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Only on this condition will the men consent to dwell with us, to be one people: if every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Shall not their livestock, their property, and every animal of theirs be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all those going out of the gate of his city heeded Hamor and Shechem his son; every male was circumcised, all those going out of the gate of his city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinahs brothers, each took his sword and came upon the city in its security and killed every male.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and fetched Dinah from Shechems house, and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They took their sheep, their oxen, and their donkeys, what was in the city and what was in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives they took captive; and they plundered even all that was in the houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have troubled me by making me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and since I am few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and kill me. I shall be destroyed, my house and I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they said, Should he treat our sister like a harlot?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
