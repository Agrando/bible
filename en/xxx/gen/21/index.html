For I have borne him a son in his old age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the same day that Isaac was weaned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore she said to Abraham, Drive away this maidservant and her son; for the son of this maidservant shall not inherit with my son, with Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the matter caused Abrahams eyes to quiver greatly because of his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God said to Abraham, Do not let your eyes quiver because of the lad or because of your maidservant. Whatever Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for in Isaac your Seed shall be called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will also make a nation of the son of the maidservant, because he is your seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water; and putting it on her shoulder, he gave it and the boy to Hagar, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the water in the skin was used up, and she placed the boy under one of the shrubs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she went and sat down across from him at a distance of about a bowshot; for she said to herself, Let me not see the death of the boy. So she sat opposite him, and lifted her voice and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God heard the voice of the lad. And the Angel of God called to Hagar out of the heavens, and said to her, What ails you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Arise, lift up the lad and support him with your hand, for I will make of him a great nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And God was with the lad; and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a great archer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore, swear to me by God that you will not deal falsely with me, with my offspring, or with my posterity; but that according to the kindness that I have done to you, you will do to me and to the land in which you have sojourned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Abraham said, I will swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Abraham rebuked Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelechs servants had seized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor had I heard of it until today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Abimelech asked Abraham, What are these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that they may be my witness that I have dug this well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because the two of them swore an oath there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. So Abimelech rose with Phicol, the commander of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and there he called upon the name of Jehovah, the Eternal God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
