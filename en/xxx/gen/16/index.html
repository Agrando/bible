And she had an Egyptian maidservant whose name was Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Sarai said to Abram, See now, Jehovah has restrained me from bearing. Please, go in to my maid; perhaps I shall build up a family by her. And Abram heeded the voice of Sarai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Sarai, Abrams wife, took Hagar her maidservant, the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Sarai said to Abram, My injustice be upon you! I gave my maid into your bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. Jehovah judge between me and you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, your maid is in your hand; do to her as is good in your eyes. And when Sarai dealt harshly with her, she fled from her presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Angel of Jehovah found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And He said, Hagar, Sarais maidservant, where have you come from, and where are you going? She said, I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Angel of Jehovah said to her, Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will multiply your seed exceedingly, so that they shall not be numbered for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Angel of Jehovah said unto her: Behold, you are with child, and you shall bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah has heard your affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall be a wild ass of a man; his hand shall be against every man, and every mans hand against him. And he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her, God-Who-Sees; for she said, Have I also here looked upon Him who sees me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
