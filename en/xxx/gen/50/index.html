So the physicians embalmed Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Forty days were fulfilled for him, for such are the days fulfilled for those who are embalmed; and the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the days of his weeping were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My father made me swear, saying, Behold, I am dying; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me. Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Pharaoh said, Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>as well as all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his fathers house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and it was a very great company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is on the other side of Jordan, and they mourned there with great and heavy lamentation. He observed seven days of mourning for his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, This is a great mourning of the Egyptians. Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is on the other side of Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So his sons did for him just as he had commanded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as property for a burial place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when Josephs brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Perhaps Joseph will hold a grudge against us, and return and repay us for all the evil which we did unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, Before your father died he commanded, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus you shall say to Joseph: I beg you, please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin; for they did evil to you. Now, please, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And his brothers also went and prostrated before his face, and they said, Behold, we are your slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Joseph said to them, Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for you, you had devised evil against me; but God had planned it for good, in order to bring it about as it is this day, to save many people alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones. And he comforted them and spoke to their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his fathers house. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joseph saw Ephraims children to the third generation. Also the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born upon Josephs knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Joseph said to his brethren, I am dying; but God will attend to visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land of which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, God will attend to visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
