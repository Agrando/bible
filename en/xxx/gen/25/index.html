And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Abraham gave gifts to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had; and while he was still living he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son, to the lands to the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>These are the days of the years of Abrahams life which he lived: one hundred and seventy-five years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer Lahai Roi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abrahams son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarahs maidservant, bore to Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These were the sons of Ishmael and these were their names, by their villages and their encampments, twelve chiefs according to their nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these were the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he expired and died, and was gathered to his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They settled from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt as you go toward Assyria. He settled in the presence of all his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And these are the generations of Isaac, Abrahams son: Abraham begot Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan, the sister of Laban the Aramean, as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren; and Jehovah was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the sons struggled together within her; and she said, If all is right, why am I like this? So she went to inquire of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehovah said to her: Two nations are in your womb, two peoples shall be separated from your body; one people shall be stronger than the other, and the older shall serve the younger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So when her days were fulfilled for her to give birth, behold, there were twins in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the first came out red. He was like a hairy garment all over; and they called his name Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Afterward his brother came out, and his hand took hold of Esaus heel; and his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the boys grew: And Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now Jacob boiled stew; and Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Esau said to Jacob, Please let me gulp down some of that red, red stew, for I am faint. Therefore his name was called Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jacob said, Sell me your birthright today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die; so what is this birthright to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Jacob said, Swear to me this day. So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils; and he ate and drank, arose, and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
