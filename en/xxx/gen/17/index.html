Walk before Me and be perfect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and I will make My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Abram fell on his face, and God spoke with him, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you a father of many nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will make you abundantly exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come forth from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your seed after you in their generations, for a perpetual covenant, to be God unto you and unto your seed after you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also I have given unto you and your seed after you the land in which you sojourn, all the land of Canaan, as an enduring possession; and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God said to Abraham: As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is My covenant which you shall keep, between Me and you and your seed after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant between Me and you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised, every male in your generations, he who is born in the house or bought with money from any son of a foreigner who is not your seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the uncircumcised male, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then God said to Abraham, As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I have blessed her and have given you a son by her; yea, I have blessed her, and she shall become nations; kings of peoples shall be from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall one be born to a man who is one hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Abraham said to God, Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And God said: Truly, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; I have established My covenant with him for a perpetual covenant, with his seed after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly abundantly.
