And Israel strengthened himself and sat up on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Jacob said to Joseph: God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and said to me, Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people, and give this land to your seed after you as an enduring possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Your offspring whom you beget after them shall be yours; they shall be called according to the name of their brothers in their inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (which is Bethlehem).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Israel saw Josephs sons, and said, Who are these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place. And he said, Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now the eyes of Israel had become dull with age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see your face; but lo, God has also shown me your seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph brought them from beside his knees, and he prostrated with his face to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israels left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israels right hand, and brought them to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on Ephraims head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manassehs head, crossing his hands; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he blessed Joseph, and said: God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me since I was born to this day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the Angel who redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; let my name be called upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it caused his eye to quiver; so he took hold of his fathers hand to remove it from Ephraims head onto Manassehs head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he blessed them that day, saying, In you Israel shall bless, saying, May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh! And thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moreover I have extended your shoulder above your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
