The Tree of Life was also in the midst of the garden, and also the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which circles around all the land of Havilah, where there is gold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and the onyx stone are there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one which circles around all the land of Cush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The name of the third river is Tigris; it is the one going toward the east of Assyria. The fourth river is Euphrates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Jehovah God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat to feed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehovah God said, It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper to complement him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Out of the ground Jehovah God formed every living thing of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the man gave names to all the animals, to the flying creatures of the heavens, and to every living thing of the field. But for the man there was not found a helper to complement him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the rib which Jehovah God had taken out of the man He rebuilt into a woman, and He brought her to the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the man said: This now at last is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore a man, leaving his father and mother, and having cleaved to his wife, they are one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
