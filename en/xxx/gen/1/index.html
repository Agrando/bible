And there was light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided between the light and darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>God called the light, Day; and the darkness He called, Night. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, separating the waters from the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And God made the firmament, and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And God called the firmament, Heavens. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear: thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters He called, Seas. And God saw that it was good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God said, Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and the fruit tree producing fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth: thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to its kind, and the tree producing fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then God said, Let there be luminaries in the firmament of the heavens, to distinguish the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and let them be for luminaries in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth: thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And God made two great luminaries: the greater luminary to rule the day, and the lesser luminary to rule the night, and also the stars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to shine upon the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Four.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then God said, Let the waters swarm with swarming living creatures, and let flying creatures fly to and fro above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So God created great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, that swarmed in the waters according to their kind, and every winged flying creature according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the flying creatures multiply on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Five.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: beasts, creeping things and living things of the earth, each according to its kind: thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And God made the living things of the earth according to its kind, beasts according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the flying creatures of the heavens, and over the beasts, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that moves on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the flying creatures of the heavens, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And God said, Behold, I have given you every plant that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Also, to every living thing of the earth, to every flying creature of the heavens, and to everything that moves on the earth, living creatures, I have given the green plants for food: thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was extremely good. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Six.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
