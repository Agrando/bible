So Pharaoh awoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he went to sleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, plump and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And behold, seven thin heads, scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the seven thin heads devoured the seven plump and full heads. And Pharaoh awoke, and lo, it was a dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and summoned all the astrologers of Egypt and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying: I remember my offenses this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me into custody in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>we each dreamed a dream in one night, he and I. Each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was a Hebrew lad with us there, a servant of the captain of the guard. And we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us; to each man he interpreted according to his dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Pharaoh sent and summoned Joseph, and they rushed him out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that you can understand a dream, to interpret it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is someone besides me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph: Behold, in my dream I stood on the bank of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And behold, seven cows came up out of the river, fat of flesh and fine looking; and they fed in the marshes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very bad looking and thin of flesh, such badness as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the thin and bad cows ate up the first seven fat cows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they had entered their stomachs, it would not have been known that they had entered their stomachs, for they looked just as bad as at the beginning. So I awoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Also I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And behold, seven heads, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads. And I told this to the astrologers, but no one could explain it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads are seven years; the dreams are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the seven thin and bad cows which came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty heads scorched by the east wind are seven years of famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Behold, seven years of great plenty are coming throughout all the land of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and after them seven years of famine will arise, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine will deplete the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the plenty will not be perceived in the land because of the famine following after, for it will be very severe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the dream was repeated unto Pharaoh twice because the thing is determined by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore, let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint deputies over the land, to collect one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven years of plenty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And let them gather all the food of those good years that are coming, and store up grain for food in the cities under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them guard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And that food shall be as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land may not perish during the famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Inasmuch as God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Pharaoh took his signet ring off his hand and put it on Josephs hand; and he clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he made him ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried out before him, Bow the knee! So he set him over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Pharaoh also said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you no man may lift his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Pharaoh called Josephs name Zaphnath-Paaneah. And he gave him as a wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On. So Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And in the seven years of plenty the land brought forth by handfuls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; he laid up in every city the food of the fields which surrounded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Joseph gathered very much grain, as the sand of the sea, until he stopped counting, for it was without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God has made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the name of the second he called Ephraim: For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt ended,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. And the famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when all the land of Egypt was hungry, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And the famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine became severe in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And all earth came to Joseph in Egypt to buy, because the famine was severe in all the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
