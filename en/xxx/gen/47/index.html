And they said to Pharaoh, Your servants are shepherds, both we and also our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they said to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land, because your servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father and your brothers have come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The land of Egypt is before you. Have your father and brothers dwell in the best of the land; let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know any men with ability among them, make them chief herdsmen over my livestock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joseph brought in his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of your life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Joseph situated his father and his brothers, and gave them property in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph sustained his father, his brothers, and all his fathers house with food, according to the mouths of the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaohs house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For the money has failed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Joseph said, Give your livestock, and I will give you bread for your livestock, if the money has failed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the cattle of the herds, and for the donkeys. Thus he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When that year had ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, We will not hide from my lord that our money is gone; my lord also has our cattle and livestock. Nothing remains before my lord but our bodies and our lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants of Pharaoh; give us seed, that we may live and not die, that the land not be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaohs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as for the people, he moved them into the cities, from one end of the borders of Egypt to the other end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had portions prescribed to them by Pharaoh, and they ate their portions which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you and your land this day for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall come to pass in the harvest that you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh; and four-fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and for your food, for those of your houses and as food for your little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they said, You have saved our lives; let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaohs servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have one-fifth, except for the land of the priests only, which did not become Pharaohs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Israel remained in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they settled on property they owned there and grew and multiplied exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacobs life was one hundred and forty-seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the time drew near for Israel to die. And he called his son Joseph and said to him, Now if I have found favor in your eyes, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but let me lie with my fathers. You shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place. And he said, I will do as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel prostrated himself on the head of the bed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
