So Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, please.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, Behold, in my dream a vine was before me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and in the vine were three branches; it was as though it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Pharaohs cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaohs cup, and put the cup into Pharaohs hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation: The three branches are three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your place, and you shall put Pharaohs cup into his hand according to the former custom, when you were his cupbearer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But remember me when it is well with you, and please show kindness to me; make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For truly I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews; and also I have done nothing here that they should have put me into the dungeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also in my dream saw three baskets of white bread on my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head from you and hang you on a tree; and the birds shall eat your flesh from off you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass on the third day, which was Pharaohs birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and of the chief baker among his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearing again, and he put the cup into Pharaohs hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
