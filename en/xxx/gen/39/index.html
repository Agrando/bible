And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian man, bought him from the hands of the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And his master saw that Jehovah was with him and that Jehovah made all he did to prosper in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Joseph found favor in his eyes, and served him. And he appointed him over his house, and all that he had he entrusted to his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it came to pass, from the time that he had appointed him over his house and all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptians house for Josephs sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had in the house and in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thus he left all that he had in Josephs hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate. Now Joseph was handsome and good looking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass after these things that his masters wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said, Lie with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he refused and said to his masters wife, Behold, my master does not know what is with me in the house, and he has entrusted all that he has into my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There is no one greater in this house than I, nor has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great evil, and sin against God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day after day, that he did not give heed to her, to lie with her or to be with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened about this time, when Joseph went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house were inside,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and went outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that she summoned the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, Behold, he has brought in to us a Hebrew man to make sport of us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it happened, when he heard that I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me, and fled and went outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So she kept his garment with her until his master came into the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she spoke to him with words like these, saying, The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me to make sport of me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, saying, Your servant did to me after this manner, that his anger burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Josephs master took him and put him into the prison house, the place where the kings prisoners were confined. And he was there in the prison house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Jehovah was with Joseph and extended mercy to him, and He gave him favor in the eyes of the warden of the prison house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the warden of the prison house entrusted into Josephs hand all the prisoners who were in the prison house; whatever they did there, it was his doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The warden of the prison house did not oversee anything that was under his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and whatever he did, Jehovah made it prosper.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
