And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Jehovah appeared to him and said: Do not go down into Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and bless you; for to you and your seed I give all these lands. And I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will make your seed multiply as the stars of the heavens; I will give to your seed all these lands; and in your Seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>because Abraham has obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, She is my sister; for he was afraid to say, She is my wife, thinking, Lest the men of the place kill me on account of Rebekah, because she was of a pleasant appearance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked through a window and saw, and behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, Behold, surely she is your wife; so why have you said, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I thought, Lest I die on account of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us? One of the people might soon have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He who touches this man or his wife shall die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and got in the same year a hundredfold; and Jehovah blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The man became great, and continued on growing in greatness until he became exceedingly great;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great number of servants. And the Philistines envied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells which his fathers servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and they had filled them with dirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you have become much mightier than we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Isaac departed from there and pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Isaac re-dug the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham. And he called them by the names which his father had called them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Isaacs servants also dug in the valley, and found a well of running water there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaacs herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. So he called the name of the well Esek, because they had contended with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they dug another well, and they strove over that one also. So he called its name Sitnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, because he said, For now Jehovah has made a large place for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went up from there to Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jehovah appeared to him the same night and said, I am the God of your father Abraham; do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your seed for My servant Abrahams sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So he built an altar there and called upon the name of Jehovah. And he pitched his tent there; and there Isaacs servants dug a well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath, one of his friends, and Phicol the commander of his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they said, We have certainly seen that Jehovah is with you. So we said, Let there now be an oath between us, between you and us; and let us make a covenant with you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that you will do us no evil, since we have not touched you, and since we have done nothing to you but good and have sent you away in peace; you being now the blessed of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they arose early in the morning and swore an oath with one another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass on the same day that Isaacs servants came and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, We have found water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he called it Shebah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Esau was forty years old when he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they were a grief of spirit to Isaac and Rebekah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
