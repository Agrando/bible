Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, do you now perfect yourselves in the flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Have you suffered so many things in vain; if indeed it was in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and displays works of power in you, does He do it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Just as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore know that those who are of faith are sons of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel before to Abraham, saying, In you all the nations shall be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For as many as are of the works of the Law are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the Law, to do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But that no one is justified by the Law in the sight of God is evident; for, The just shall live by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet the Law is not of faith; but, The man who does them shall live in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though it is only a mans covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, And to seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to your Seed, who is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this I say, A covenant having been established before by God in Christ, the Law coming into being four hundred and thirty years later, does not annul the promise, so as to abolish it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the inheritance is of the Law, it is no longer of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What purpose then does the Law serve? It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is the Law then against the promises of God? Let it not be. For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been out of the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by the faith of Jesus Christ might be given to those believing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the Law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore the Law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as many of you as were immersed into Christ have put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if you are Christs, then you are Abrahams seed, and heirs according to the promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
