You have not wronged me at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then was the blessing you enjoyed? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They zealously pursue you, but not well; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My little children, for whom I travail again until Christ is formed in you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, you who desire to be under the Law, do you not hear the Law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, and is in bondage with her children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but the Jerusalem from above is free, which is the mother of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written: Rejoice, O barren, you who do not bear. Break forth and shout, you who are not in labor. For the desolate has many more children than she who has a husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
