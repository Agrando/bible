Let it not be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I confirm myself as a transgressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I through the Law died to the Law that I might live to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died in vain.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
