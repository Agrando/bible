Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you into the grace of Christ, to a different gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>which is not another; but there are some who trouble you, even determined to pervert the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But even if we, or an angel from Heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but by a revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mothers womb and called me through His grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to inquire of Peter, and remained with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I saw none of the other apostles except Jacob, the Lords brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(Now concerning the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they were hearing only, He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once tried to destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they glorified God in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
