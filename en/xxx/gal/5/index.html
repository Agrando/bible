Who hindered you from obeying the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he may be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I could wish that those who unsettle your minds would even cut themselves off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you are not consumed by one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, sexual perversion, uncleanness, licentiousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>meekness, self-control. Against such there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And those who are ChristÂ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
