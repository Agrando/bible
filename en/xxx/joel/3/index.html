And I will enter into judgment with them there, on account of My people and My possession, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations; and divided up My land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they have cast lots for My people. And have given a boy as payment for a prostitute and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And also, what are you to Me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Will you restore a recompense to Me? And if you are dealing out to Me, I will return your dealings upon your own head, swiftly, speedily,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>because you have taken My silver and My gold and have carried My desirable good things to your temples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have also sold the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks, that you might remove them far from their borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, I will arouse them from the place where you have sold them, and will return your dealings upon your own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off. For Jehovah has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Proclaim this among the nations: Consecrate a war; wake up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near; let them come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weak say, I am strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Assemble yourselves and come, all you nations; and gather yourselves together all around. O Jehovah, bring down Your mighty ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let the nations be awakened and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. For there I will sit to judge all the nations all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, go down, for the press is full, the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their brightness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jehovah roars from Zion, and He utters His voice from Jerusalem. And the heavens and the earth quake. But Jehovah is a refuge for His people and a fortress to the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you shall know that I am Jehovah your God dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and foreigners shall no more pass through her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drip with new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the ravines of Judah shall flow with waters. And a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and it shall water the valley of Shittim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, because of the violence done to the sons of Judah, whose innocent blood they poured out in their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Judah will dwell forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I will acquit them of the guilt of blood which I had not acquitted; for Jehovah dwells in Zion.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
