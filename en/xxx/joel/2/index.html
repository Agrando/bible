Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble. For the day of Jehovah approaches, it is near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread out on the mountains, a great and a strong people. There has never been the like, nor shall there ever be again to the years of many generations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>a fire devours before them, and a flame burns behind them. The land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them is a desolate wilderness; yea, also nothing shall escape them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their appearance is like horses; and as horsemen, so they run.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They leap on the tops of the mountains with a sound like chariots, like the sound of flames of fire that devour the chaff, as a strong people set in battle array.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Before their face the people writhe in pain; all faces gather heat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They run like mighty ones; they go up the wall as men of war. And they each go on his way, and they do not break ranks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And each does not press his brother; they each go in their own paths. And if they fall behind their weapon, they are not cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They run to and fro in the city; they run on the wall; they climb up on the houses; they enter in by the windows, like a thief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The earth quakes before them, the heavens tremble. The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars withdraw their brightness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah gives His voice before His army, for His camp is very great. For he who does His Word is strong. For the day of Jehovah is very great and terrifying, and who can endure it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet even now turn to Me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning, declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So, tear your heart, and not your garments; and return to Jehovah your God. For He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and He has compassion concerning the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who knows if He will turn and have pity and leave a blessing behind Him, a food offering and a drink offering for Jehovah your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Blow the shofar in Zion, consecrate a fast, call a solemn assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Gather the people, consecrate the assembly, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those who suck the breasts. Let the bridegroom go out of his chamber, and the bride out of her room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar; and let them say, Have compassion on Your people, O Jehovah, and do not give Your possession to reproach, that the nations should rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jehovah will be jealous for His land and have pity on His people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yea, Jehovah will answer and say to His people, Behold, I will send you grain, and wine, and oil, and you shall be satisfied with it. And I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I will remove the northern army far from you, and I will drive him into a dry and desolate land with his face toward the eastern sea, and his back toward the western sea. And his stench shall come up, and his foul odor shall rise, because he did things to magnify himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice, for Jehovah will do things to magnify Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness grow green, for the tree bears its fruit, the fig tree and the vine yield their strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Be glad then, you sons of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God. For He has given to you the early rain according to righteousness, and He will cause the rain to come down for you, the early rain and the latter rain in the first month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the threshing floors shall be full with grain, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will restore to you the years which the swarming locust has eaten, the locust larvae, and the consuming locust, and the chewing locust, My great army which I sent among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied; and you shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And My people shall never be be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is no other. And My people shall never be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh. And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also I will pour out My Spirit on the menservants and on the maidservants in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will show signs in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and awesome day of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it shall be, that whoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall escape. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as Jehovah has said, and among the survivors whom Jehovah shall call.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
