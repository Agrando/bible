Thus there will be more than enough contempt and wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If it please the king, let a royal decree go out from him, and let it be recorded in the laws of Persia and Media, so that it shall not become obsolete, that Vashti shall come no more before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal power to another woman who is better than she.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the kings decree which he will make is proclaimed throughout all his empire (for it is great), all wives will honor their husbands, both great and small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the words pleased the king and the rulers, and the king did according to the word of Memucan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he sent letters to all the kings provinces, to each province in its own writing, and to every people in their own language: That each man should rule in his own house; and that it should be spoken in the language of each nation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
