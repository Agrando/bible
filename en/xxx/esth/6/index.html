So it was commanded to bring the book of the records of the chronicles; and they were recited before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the kings officials, the doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the king said, What honor or dignity has been bestowed upon Mordecai for this? And the kings servants who attended him said, Nothing has been done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the kings house to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The kings servants said to him, Behold, Haman is standing in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Haman came in, and the king said unto him, What shall be done for the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman thought in his heart, Whom would the king delight to honor more than myself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let the royal apparel be brought which the king has worn, and a horse on which the king has ridden, and the royal crown which has been placed upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the kings most noble rulers, that he may array the man whom the king delights to honor. Then have him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him: Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the king said to Haman, Hurry! Take the apparel and the horse, just as you have suggested, and do so for Mordecai the Jew who sits in the kings gate! Do not fail to do any of all that you have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Haman took the apparel and the horse, arrayed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Afterward Mordecai went back to the kings gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him, his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the seed of the Jews, you will not prevail against him but shall be thrown down and fall before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>While they were still talking with him, the kings officials came, and hastened to bring Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
