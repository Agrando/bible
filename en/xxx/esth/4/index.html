Then she sent garments to clothe Mordecai and take his sackcloth away from him, but he would not accept them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Esther called Hathach, one of the kings officials whom he had appointed to attend her, and she gave him a command concerning Mordecai, to learn what and why this was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square that was in front of the kings gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the kings treasuries to destroy the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He also gave him a copy of the written decree for their destruction, which was given at Shushan, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her, and that he might command her to go in to the king to make supplication to him and plead before him for her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hathach returned and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Again Esther spoke to Hathach, and charged him to say to Mordecai:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All the kings servants and the people of the kings provinces know that any man or woman who goes into the inner court to the king, who has not been summoned, has but one law: to put all to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter, that he may live. Furthermore, I have not been called to go in to the king these thirty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they told Mordecai Esthers words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Mordecai told them to answer Esther: Do not think in your soul that you will escape in the kings house any more than all the other Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your fathers house shall perish. Yet who knows whether you have attained unto the kingdom for such a time as this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Go, gather all the Jews who are found in Shushan, and fast for me; neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will fast likewise. And so I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I have perished, I have perished!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Mordecai went his way and did according to all that Esther commanded him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
