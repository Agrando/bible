It shall be granted you. And what is your request? It shall be done, even to half the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Queen Esther answered and said, If I have found favor in your eyes, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For we have been sold, my people and I, to be annihilated, killed and destroyed. Had we been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept silent, although the enemy could never compensate for the kings loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther, Who is he, and where is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this evil Haman! Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the king arose from the the banquet of wine in his wrath and went into the palace garden; but Haman stood before Queen Esther, to request for his soul, for he perceived that evil was determined against him by the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet of wine, Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, Will he also violate the queen while I am in the house? As the word left the kings mouth, they covered Hamans face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now Harbonah, one of the officials, said to the king, Behold, the gallows, fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke good on the kings behalf, is standing at the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him on it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the kings wrath was pacified.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
