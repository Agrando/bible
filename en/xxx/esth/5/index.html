Then Esther went near and touched the top of the scepter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said to her, What do you wish, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given to you, even to half the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Esther answered, If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the king said, Summon Haman quickly, that he may do according to Esthers word. So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>At the banquet of wine the king said to Esther, What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request? And it shall be done, even to half the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Esther answered and said, My petition and request is this:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, then let the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do according to the word of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Haman went out that day joyful and with a glad heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the kings gate, and that he did not stand or tremble before him, he was filled with indignation against Mordecai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went to his house, and he sent and summoned his friends and his wife Zeresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, everything in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the rulers and servants of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Moreover Haman said, In addition to that, Queen Esther invited no one to come in with the king to the banquet that she prepared, except me; and tomorrow I am again invited by her, along with the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the kings gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, Let a gallows be made, fifty cubits high, and in the morning suggest to the king that Mordecai be hanged on it; then go joyfully with the king to the banquet. And these words were good to Haman; so he had the gallows made.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
