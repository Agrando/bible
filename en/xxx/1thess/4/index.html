But we urge you, brethren, that you abound more and more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that you also aspire to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and that you may have need of nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are asleep, that you sorrow not as others who have no hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this we say to you by the Word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the Lord Himself will descend from Heaven with a shouted command, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together at the same time with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore encourage one another with these words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
