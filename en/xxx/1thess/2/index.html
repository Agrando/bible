For you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, just as they did from the Judeans,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have driven us out; and they do not please God and are contrary to all men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, so as always to fill up the measure of their sins; but wrath has come upon them to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored more eagerly, with great desire, to see your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore we wanted to come to you; even I, Paul, time and again; but Satan hindered us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Is it not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you are our glory and joy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
