It came to pass in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>that Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said to me, The survivors who are left from the captivity in the province are there in great distress and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So it was, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned for days; and was fasting and praying before the God of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I said, I beseech You, O Jehovah the God of Heaven, O great and awesome Mighty God, You who keep Your covenant and mercy with those who love You and keep Your commandments:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open, that You may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You now, day and night, for the children of Israel Your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both my fathers house and I have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>We have acted very corruptly against You, and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Remember, I beseech You, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, If you act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but if you return to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though you were cast out to the ends of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and bring them to the place where I have chosen to establish My name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now these are Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great power, and by Your strong hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>O Lord, I beseech You, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who delight to fear Your name; and give Your servant success this day, and grant him mercy before this man. For I was the kings cupbearer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
