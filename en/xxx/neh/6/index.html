But they thought to do evil to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and come down to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In it was written: It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says, that you and the Jews plan to rebel; for which reason, according to these rumors, you are rebuilding the wall, that you may be their king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah! Now these matters will be reported to the king. So come, therefore, and let us consult together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then I sent to him, saying, No such things as you say are being done, but you contrive them out of your own heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they all were trying to make us afraid, saying, Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will not be done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was under restraints; and he said, Let us gather in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, at night they will come to kill you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? And who is there such as I who would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then I perceived that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this reason he was hired, that I should be afraid and do accordingly and sin, to make for a bad reputation, that they might reproach me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these works of theirs, and the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who were terrifying me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations around us saw these things, that they were cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work had been done by our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and those from Tobiah came to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had taken in marriage the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They also reported his good deeds before me, and were delivering my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to make me afraid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
