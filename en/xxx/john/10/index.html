If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But a hireling, he who is not the shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am the Good Shepherd; and I know My sheep, and am known by My own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As the Father knows Me, even so I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must lead, and they will hear My voice; and there will be one flock and one Shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This precept I have received from My Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore there was a division again among the Jews because of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And many of them said, He has a demon and is mad. Why do you listen to Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, These are not the words of one who has a demon. A demon is not able to open the eyes of the blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now it was the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomons porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the Jews surrounded Him and said to Him, How long do You keep us in doubt? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Fathers name, they bear witness concerning Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, as I said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I give them eternal life, and they shall never ever perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one has the power to snatch them out of My Fathers hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, Many good works I have shown you from My Father. For which of those works do you stone Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered Him, saying, For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, make Yourself God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your Law, I said, You are gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If He called them gods, to whom the Word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they sought again to seize Him, but He escaped out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was immersing at first, and there He stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then many came to Him and said, John performed no sign, but all the things that John spoke about this Man were true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed into Him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
