And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simons son, who was about to betray Him, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the moneybag; and he used to take what was put in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jesus said, Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of My burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now a great many of the Jews knew that He was there; and they came, not because of Jesus only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the chief priests took counsel to put Lazarus to death also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because on account of him many of the Jews went away and continued to believe into Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The next day a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him, and cried out: Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! The King of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus, when He had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King is coming, sitting on a donkeys colt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that they had done these things to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore the crowd, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead, bore witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For this reason also the crowd met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Behold, the world has gone after Him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now there were certain Greeks among those who came up to do homage at the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it unto eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me, My Father will honor him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me out of this hour? But for this purpose I came unto this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify Your name. Then a voice came from Heaven, saying, I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, An angel has spoken to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered and said, This voice did not come because of Me, but because of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all to Myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>This He said, signifying by what sort of death He was about to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The people answered Him, We have heard out of the Law that the Christ remains forever; and how can You say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Jesus said to them, A little while longer the Light is with you. Walk while you have the Light, that darkness not overtake you; for he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While you have the Light, believe into the Light, that you may become sons of Light. These things Jesus spoke, and departed, and was hidden from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But although He had done so many signs before them, they did not believe into Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they were not able to believe, because Isaiah said again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, that they should not see with their eyes, that they should not understand with their hearts and be turned, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed into Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, that they might not be put out of the synagogue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Jesus cried out and said, He who believes into Me, believes not into Me but into Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I have come as a Light into the world, that everyone believing into Me should not remain in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him; the Word that I speak will judge him in the Last Day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who sent Me gives Me orders, what I should say and what I should speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that His command is eternal life. Therefore, whatever I speak, just as the Father has said unto Me, so I speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
