Jesus therefore, being wearied from His journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give Me a drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman? For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would give you living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The woman said to Him, Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will not ever thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I have no husband,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; in that you spoke truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers did homage on this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the right place to do homage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will do homage to the Father neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You do homage to what you do not know; we do homage to what we know, for salvation is of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will do homage to the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father seeks such to do homage to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God is Spirit, and those who do homage to Him must do homage in spirit and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming (who is called Christ). When He comes, He will make known all things to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus said to her, I AM! the One speaking to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He talked with a woman; yet no one said, What do You seek? or, Why are You talking with her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The woman then left her waterpot, went her way into the city, and said to the men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Come, see a Man who told me everything that I ever did. Is this not the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they went out of the city and came to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In the meantime His disciples urged Him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But He said to them, I have food to eat of which you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore the disciples said to one another, Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do you not say, There are yet four months and then comes the harvest? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For in this the saying is true: One sows and another reaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed into Him because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me everything that I ever did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So when the Samaritans had come to Him, they begged Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many more believed through His Word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is truly the Christ, the Savior of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now after two days He departed from there and went into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also had gone to the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and begged Him to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The nobleman said to Him, Sir, come down before my child dies!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said to him, Go your way; your son lives. So the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him, saying, Your son lives!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then he inquired of them the hour when he got better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself believed, and his whole household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This again is the second sign Jesus did when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
