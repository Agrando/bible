And they struck Him with their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Pilate then went out again, and said to them, Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Behold the Man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify Him, crucify Him! Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore, when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more terrified,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and went again into the Praetorium, and said to Jesus, Where are You from? But Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Pilate said to Him, Do You not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to crucify You, and authority to release You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered, You could have no authority at all against Me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From then on Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this Man go, you are not Caesars friend. Everyone making himself a king speaks against Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, Behold your King!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But they cried out, Away with Him, away with Him! Crucify Him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led Him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He, bearing His cross, went out to a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews, but, He said, I am the King of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They said therefore among themselves, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots. Therefore the soldiers did these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mothers sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, Woman, behold your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then He said to the disciple, Behold your mother. And from that hour that disciple took her into his own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now a vessel full of vinegar was sitting there; and they filled a sponge with vinegar, put it on hyssop, and put it to His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So when Jesus had received the vinegar, He said, It has been finished! And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, because it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he who has seen has borne witness, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he speaks the truth, so that you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, Not one of His bones shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another Scripture says, They shall look on Him whom they pierced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. And he came and took the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews Preparation Day, for the tomb was nearby.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
