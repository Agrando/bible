My hour has not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there were set there six stone waterpots, according to the manner of purification of the Jews, containing two or three measures each.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And He said to them, Draw some out now, and take it to the master of the feast. And they brought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and he said to him, Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine, and when the guests have well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this He went down to Capernaum, He, His mother, His brothers, and His disciples; and they stayed there not many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when He had made a whip out of rope, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers money and overturned the tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He said to those who sold doves, Take these things away from here! Do not make My Fathers house a house of merchandise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for Your house has consumed Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the Jews answered and said to Him, What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the Jews said, It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But He was speaking of the temple of His body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them; and they believed the Scripture and the Word which Jesus had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name when they saw the signs which He did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew everyone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and had no need that anyone should bear witness of man, for He knew what was in man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
