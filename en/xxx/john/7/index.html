If You do these things, make Yourself known to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For neither did His brothers believe into Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jesus said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you; but it hates Me because I bear witness of it that its works are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to the feast, for My time has not yet been fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When He had said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the Jews sought Him at the feast, and said, Where is He?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning Him. Some said, He is good; others said, No, rather, He leads the multitudes astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Jews marveled, saying, How does this Man know letters, having never studied?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone wants to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak out of Myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not Moses give you the Law, yet none of you keeps the Law? Why do you seek to kill Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The people answered and said, You have a demon. Who seeks to kill You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and you all marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the Law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then some of them from Jerusalem said, Is this not He whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But behold, He speaks boldly, and they say nothing to Him. Perhaps the rulers truly know that this is truly the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>However, we know where this Man is from; but when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus cried out, as He taught in the temple, saying, You both know Me, and you know where I am from; and I have not come from Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore they sought to take Him; but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And many out of the crowd believed into Him, and said, When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than these which this Man has done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Jesus said to them, I shall be with you a little while longer, and then I go to Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You will seek Me and not find Me, and where I am you are not able to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then the Jews said among themselves, Where does He intend to go that we shall not find Him? He does not intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, does He?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What is this thing that He said, You will seek Me and not find Me, and where I am you are not able to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing into Him were about to receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore many from the crowd, when they heard this saying, said, Truly this is the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Christ does not come out of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there was a division in the crowd because of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And some of them wanted to take Him, but no one laid hands on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, Why have you not brought Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, No man ever spoke like this Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the Pharisees answered them, Have you not also been led astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed into Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this crowd that does not know the Law is accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus (he who came to Jesus by night, being one of them) said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Does our Law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he does?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search and look, for no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And each one went to his own house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
