And that day was the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered them, He who made me well said to me, Take up your bed and walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a multitude being in that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you have been made well. Sin no more, that a worse thing not come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son is not able to do anything from Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself does; and He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as the Father raises the dead and gives life, even so the Son gives life to whom He wills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who has sent Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My Word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed from death unto life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and has also given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and come forth; those who have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and those who have practiced evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I am able to do nothing from Myself. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If I bear witness concerning Myself, My testimony is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There is another who bears witness concerning Me, and I know that the testimony which He witnesses concerning Me is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Yet I do not receive testimony from man, but I say these things that you may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have a greater testimony than Johns; for the works which the Father has given Me to finish, the very works that I do, bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the Father Himself, who sent Me, has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And you do not have His Word abiding in you, because whom He sent, Him you do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I do not receive honor from men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I have come in My Fathers name, and you do not receive Me. If another comes in his own name, him you will receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can you believe, who receive honor from one another, and do not seek the honor that comes from God only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; there is one who accuses you; Moses, in whom you have hoped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
