And Peter says to Him, Lord, do You wash my feet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered and said to him, What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will come to understand after this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter said to Him, You shall certainly not ever wash my feet! Jesus answered him, If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has no other need than to wash his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For He knew who was betraying Him; therefore He said, Not everyone of you is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and reclined again, He said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one anothers feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, A servant is not greater than his master; nor is the messenger greater than the one sending him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now I tell you before it happens, that when it does come to pass, you may believe that I AM.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, He who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you will betray Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom He spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now there was reclining at Jesus bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter therefore nodded to him to ask who it might be of whom He spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then, leaning back on Jesus breast, he said to Him, Lord, who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give a morsel when I have dipped it. And having dipped the morsel, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after the morsel, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But no one at the table knew for what reason He said this to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For some thought, because Judas had the moneybag, that Jesus was saying to him, Buy those things we need for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Having received the morsel, he then went out immediately. And it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So, when he had gone out, Jesus said, Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and glorify Him at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Little children, I shall be with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, Where I am going, you are not able to come, so now I say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I love you, that you also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you have love mutually with one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, where are You going? Jesus answered him, Where I am going you are not able to follow Me now, but you shall follow Me afterward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter said to Him, Lord, why am I not able to follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster shall not crow till you will deny Me three times.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
