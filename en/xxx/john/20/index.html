She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned and said to Him, Rabboni! (which is to say, Teacher)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to her, Do not cling to Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Jesus said to them again, Peace to you. As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; whatever you lay hold upon, it is held fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Thomas, called the Twin, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. So he said to them, Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not ever believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then He said to Thomas, Bring your finger here, and look at My hands; and bring your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Thomas answered and said to Him, My Lord and my God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those not seeing and yet believing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And truly Jesus did many other signs before His disciples, which are not written in this book;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
