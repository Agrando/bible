And these things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I am going away to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, Where are You going?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>concerning righteousness, because I go to My Father and you no longer see Me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I still have many things to say to you, but you are not able to bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, when He, the Spirit of Truth, has come, He will guide you into all Truth; for He will not speak things originating from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will make known to you things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify Me, for He will receive from what is Mine and make it known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will receive from what is Mine and make it known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little while, and you do not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me, because I go away to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then His disciples said among themselves, What is this that He says to us, A little while, and you do not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me; and, because I go to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They said therefore, What is this that He says, A little while? We do not understand what He says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and He said to them, Do you seek answers among yourselves that I said, A little while, and you do not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will become joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow because her hour has come; but as soon as she gives birth to the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a person has been born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore you now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one takes your joy from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but I will clearly make known to you concerning the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples said to Him, Behold, now You are speaking plainly, and using no figure of speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we are sure that You know all things, and have no need that anyone should question You. By this we believe that You came forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, the hour is coming, yes, has now come, that you are scattered, each to his own, and will leave Me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction; but be of good courage, I have overcome the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
