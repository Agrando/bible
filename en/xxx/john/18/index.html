Jesus said to them, I AM! And Judas, who betrayed Him, also stood with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now when He said to them, I AM, they fell backwards and were thrown to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then He asked them again, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus answered, I have told you that I AM. Therefore, if you seek Me, let these go their way;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke, Of those whom You gave Me I have lost not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priests servant, and cut off his right ear. The servants name was Malchus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the company of troops and the commander and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they led Him away to Annas first, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was high priest that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was Caiaphas who gave counsel to the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought Peter in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, Are you not also one of this Mans disciples? He said, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there, for it was cold, and they warmed themselves. And Peter stood with them and warmed himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where the Jews always meet, and in secret I have said nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Why do you question Me? Ask those who have heard Me what I said to them. Behold, they know what I said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when He had said these things, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Do You answer the high priest this way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do you strike Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. Therefore they said to him, Are you not also one of His disciples? He denied it and said, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of him whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peter then denied again; and immediately a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early. But they themselves did not go into the Praetorium, that they should not be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Pilate then went out to them and said, What accusation do you bring against this Man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They answered and said to him, If He were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him up to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Pilate said to them, You take Him and judge Him according to your Law. Therefore the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke, signifying by what death He would die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again, called Jesus, and said to Him, Are You the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered him, Do you say this from yourself, or did others tell you this concerning Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Pilate therefore said to Him, Are You a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the Truth. Everyone who is of the Truth hears My voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pilate said to Him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, I find no fault in Him at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Do you therefore want me to release to you the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then they all cried again, saying, Not this Man, but Barabbas! Now Barabbas was a robber.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
