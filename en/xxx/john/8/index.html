And when they had set her in the midst,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>they said to Him, Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now Moses, in the Law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This they said, testing Him, that they might have something of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as though He did not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then those who heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, I am the Light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the Light of Life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Pharisees therefore said to Him, You bear witness of Yourself; Your testimony is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness of Myself, My testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And yet if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It is also written in your Law that the testimony of two men is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am One who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they said to Him, Where is Your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one laid hands on Him, for His hour had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus said to them again, I am going away, and you will seek Me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you are not able to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the Jews said, Will He kill Himself, because He says, Where I go you are not able to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above. You are from this world; I am not from this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then they said to Him, Who are You? And Jesus said to them, The Beginning; what I have been saying to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I heard from Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I AM, and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone, for I always do those things that please Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As He spoke these words, many believed into Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed in Him, If you continue to abide in My Word, you are truly My disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered Him, We are Abrahams seed, and have been in slavery to no one at any time. How can You say, You will be made free?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone practicing sin is a slave of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And a slave does not remain in the house forever, but the son remains forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore if the Son sets you free, you shall truly be free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that you are Abrahams seed, but you seek to kill Me, because My Word has no place in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you do what you have seen with your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered and said to Him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abrahams children, you would do the works of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But now you seek to kill Me, a Man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You do the works of your father. Then they said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father; God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come from Myself, but He sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to hear My Word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You are of the devil as your father, and the lusts of your father you purpose to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own, for he is a liar and the father of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He who is of God hears Gods Words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then the Jews answered and said to Him, Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered, I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I do not seek My own glory; there is One who seeks and judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, If anyone keeps My Word he shall certainly never ever see death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then the Jews said to Him, Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and You say, If anyone keeps My Word he shall never ever taste death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died. Whom do You make Yourself out to be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My honor is nothing. It is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I say, I do not know Him, I shall be a liar like you; but I do know Him and keep His Word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then the Jews said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came to be, I AM.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus was hidden and went forth out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
