Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks He distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those sitting down; and likewise of the fish, as much as they desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, so that nothing is lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, He withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when evening had come, His disciples went down to the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>got into the boat, and went across the sea toward Capernaum. And it was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sea arose because a great wind was blowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But He said to them, It is I. Do not be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they willingly received Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the following day, when the people who were standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>however, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they also got into boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did You come here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they said to Him, What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore they said to Him, What sign do You show then, that we may see and believe You? What do You work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread from Heaven to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread out of Heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the bread of God is He who comes down from Heaven and gives life to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then they said to Him, Lord, give us this bread always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus said to them, I am the Bread of Life. He who comes to Me shall not ever hunger, and he who believes into Me shall never ever thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I said to you that you also have seen Me and do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I have come down out of Heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>This is the will of the Father who sent Me, that of all He has given Me I should not lose any of it, but should raise it up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes into Him may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Jews then murmured about Him, because He said, I am the Bread coming down out of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that He says, I have come down out of Heaven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Do not murmur among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>It is written in the Prophets, And they shall all be taught by God. Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God; He has seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes into Me has eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am the Bread of Life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>This is the Bread which comes down out of Heaven, that one may eat of it and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I am the Living Bread which came down out of Heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews therefore argued among themselves, saying, How can this Man give us His flesh to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For My flesh is truly food, and My blood is truly drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As the living Father sent Me, and I live through the Father, so he who feeds on Me will live through Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is the Bread which came down out of Heaven; not as your fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who is able to hear it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples murmured about this, He said to them, Does this offend you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend where He was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh does not profit; not a thing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who were not believing, and who would betray Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And He said, Therefore I have said to you that no one is able to come to Me unless it has been granted to him from My Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then Jesus said to the twelve, Do you also want to go away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the Words of eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And we have believed and understood that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you, the twelve, but one of you is a devil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, for it was he who was about to betray Him, being one of the twelve.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
