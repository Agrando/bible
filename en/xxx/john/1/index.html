The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, I am not the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? He said, I am not. Are you the Prophet? And he answered, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then they said to him, Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now those who were sent were from the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they asked him, saying, Why then do you immerse if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them, saying, I immerse in water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It is He who, arriving after me, appeared in history before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was immersing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day John sees Jesus coming toward him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is He of whom I said, After me arrives a Man who appeared in history before me, for He existed before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I did not know Him; but that He should be revealed to Israel, therefore I come immersing in water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John bore witness, saying, I saw the Spirit descending out of Heaven like a dove, and He abode upon Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I did not know Him, but He who sent me to immerse in water said to me, Upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, this is He who immerses in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, What do you seek? They said to Him, Rabbi (which is to say, when translated, Teacher), where are You staying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He said to them, Come and see. They came and saw where He was staying, and remained with Him that day (now it was about the tenth hour).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon PeterÂ’s brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which is translated, the Christ).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus looked at him, He said, You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas (which is translated, Peter).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him, Follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law, and also the Prophets, wrote; Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael said to Him, From where do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael answered and said to Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see Heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
