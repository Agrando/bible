As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the Vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for apart from Me there is not a thing you are able to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you abide in Me, and My Words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall happen unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; thus you will be My disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the Father loves Me, I also love you; continue in My love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you keep My commandments, you will continue in My love, just as I have kept My Fathers commandments and continue in His love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is My commandment, that you love one another as I love you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down ones life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master does; but I have called you friends, for all things that I hear from My Father I make known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These things I command you, that you love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the Word that I said to you, A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My Word, they will keep yours also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But all these things they will do to you on account of My name, because they do not know Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who hates Me hates My Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would have no sin. But now they have seen and also hated both Me and My Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Moreover, that the Word might be fulfilled which is written in their law, They hated Me without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth who proceeds from the Father, He will bear witness concerning Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you also will bear witness, because you are with Me from the beginning.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
