They said to him, We are coming with you also. They went out and immediately got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Jesus said to them, Children, you do not have any fish, do you? They answered Him, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some. So they cast, and now they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he was naked), and plunged into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits), dragging the net with fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then, as soon as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish which you have caught now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus said to them, Come and eat breakfast. Yet none of the disciples dared ask Him, Who are You? knowing that it was the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is now the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord; You know that I am deeply fond of You. He said to him, Feed My lambs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said to him again a second time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me? He said to Him, Yes, Lord; You know that I am deeply fond of You. He said to him, Tend My sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, are you deeply fond of Me? Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, Are you deeply fond of Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You discern all things; You know that I am deeply fond of You. Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This He spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, Follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also had leaned on His breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is the one who betrays You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, But Lord, what about this man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to him, If I intend for him to remain till I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then this saying went out among the brethren that this disciple does not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he does not die, but, If I intend for him to remain till I come, what is that to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things, and writes these things; and we know that his testimony is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
