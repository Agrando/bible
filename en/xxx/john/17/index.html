Glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>as You have given Him authority over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to as many as You have given Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have glorified You on the earth. I have finished the work which You gave Me to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now, O Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world existed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your Word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now they have known that all things, whatever You gave Me, are from You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I have given to them the Words which You have given Me; and they received them, and surely know that I came forth from You; and they believe that You sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I am glorified in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep through Your name those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>While I was with them in the world, I cared for them in Your name. Those whom You gave Me I have guarded; and not one of them is lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But now I am coming to You, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have given them Your Word; and the world hates them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I do not pray that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Sanctify them in Your Truth. Your Word is Truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As You sent Me into the world, I also sent them into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And on their behalf I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified in Truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I do not pray concerning these alone, but also concerning those who will believe into Me through their word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made complete in one, and that the world may know that You sent Me, and love them as You love Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Father, I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You gave Me; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>O righteous Father, the world has not known You, but I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I have made known to them Your name, and will make it known, that the love with which You love Me may be in them, and I in them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
