He is not able to enter a second time into his mothers womb and be born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born from above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Spirit breathes where He wishes, and you hear His voice, but do not know where He comes from and where He goes. So is everyone who is born from the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to him, Are you a teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak what We know and bear witness to what We have seen, and you do not receive Our testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you Heavenly things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No one has ascended to Heaven but He who came down from Heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that everyone believing into Him should not perish but have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone believing into Him should not perish but have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The one believing into Him is not judged; but the one not believing is judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For everyone practicing evil hates the Light and does not come to the Light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the one doing the truth comes to the Light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been worked in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He remained with them and immersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And John also was immersing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were immersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For John had not yet been thrown into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then there arose a dispute between some of Johns disciples and the Jews about purification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore witness; behold, He is immersing, and everyone is coming to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, I have been sent to go before Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegrooms voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He must increase, but I must decrease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth. He who comes from Heaven is above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what He has seen and heard, this He testifies; and no one receives His testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He who has received His testimony has set his seal that God is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For He whom God has sent speaks the Words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The one believing into the Son has eternal life; but the one disobeying the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
