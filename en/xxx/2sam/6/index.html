And Jehovah blessed Obed-Edom and all his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it was reported to King David, saying, Jehovah has blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And so it was, when those bearing the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, that he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David was dancing before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of Jehovah with shouting and with the sound of the shofar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as the ark of Jehovah was coming into the City of David, Michal, Sauls daughter, looked through a window and saw King David leaping and whirling before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they brought the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place in the midst of the tent that David had erected for it. And David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when David finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he distributed among all the people, among the whole multitude of Israel, both the women and the men, to everyone a cake of bread, a piece of meat, and a cake of raisins. And all the people departed, everyone to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, uncovering himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the worthless fellows uncovers to reveal himself!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David said to Michal, It was before Jehovah, who chose me instead of your father and all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of Jehovah, over Israel. Therefore I have danced before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I have been even more lightly esteemed than this, and humble in my own eyes. But as for the handmaids of whom you have spoken, by them I was honored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
