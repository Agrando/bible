But David remained at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it happened at night time, that David arose from his bed and walked around on the roof of the kings house. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very pleasant in appearance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David sent and inquired after the woman. And someone said, Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came to him, and he lay with her. And when she was sanctified from her uncleanness, she returned to her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the woman conceived; and sent and reported to David, and said, I am with child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when Uriah came to him, David asked after Joabs welfare, and the peoples welfare, and the progress of the war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said to Uriah, Go down to your house and wash your feet. So Uriah departed from the kings house, and a portion of food from the king followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Uriah slept at the door of the kings house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So when they reported to David, saying, Uriah did not go down to his house, David said to Uriah, Did you not come from a journey? Why have you not gone down to your house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Uriah said to David, The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in booths, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped on the face of the land. Shall I then go to my house to eat and drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David said to Uriah, Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will send you away. So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when David summoned him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. And at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the morning it happened that David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront of the strongest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck down and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So it was, while Joab besieged the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew there were valiant men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab. And some of the people of the servants of David fell; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joab sent and reported to David all the things concerning the war,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and charged the messenger, saying, When you have finished speaking of the matters of the war to the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>if it happens that the kings wrath arises, and he says to you: Why did you approach so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast a piece of millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you go near the wall? then you shall say, Your servant Uriah the Hittite has died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the messenger went, and came and reported to David all that Joab had sent by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field; then we were upon them as far as the entrance of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the archers shot from the wall at your servants; and some of the kings servants died, and your servant Uriah the Hittite has also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David said to the messenger, Thus you shall say to Joab: Do not let this thing cause your eye to quiver, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen the battle against the city, and overthrow it. And encourage him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband had died, she mourned for her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when her mourning was passed, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done caused the eyes of Jehovah to quiver.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
