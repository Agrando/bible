Thus says David the son of Jesse; thus says the man raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The Spirit of Jehovah has spoken by me, and His Word was on my tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The God of Israel has said, the Rock of Israel has spoken to me: He who rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he shall be like the light of the morning when the sun rises, a morning without clouds, like the tender grass springing out of the earth, by clear shining after rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Although my house is not so with the Mighty God, yet He has made with me a perpetual covenant, ordered in all things and secure. For all my salvation and all my desire, will He not make it grow?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the sons of worthlessness shall all be as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear, and they shall be burned with fire to be burned in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>These are the names of Davids mighty men: Josheb-Basshebeth the Tachmonite, chief among the commanders. He was called Adino the Eznite, because he killed eight hundred men at one time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel retreated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He rose up and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword. Jehovah brought about a great deliverance that day; and the people returned after him only to plunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines had gathered together into a troop where there was a piece of ground full of lentils, and the people had fled before the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he took his stand in the middle of the plot, delivered it, and struck the Philistines. And Jehovah brought about a great deliverance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And three of the thirty chief men went down at harvest time and came to David at the cave of Adullam. And the company of the Philistines encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David longed and said, Oh, that someone would give me a drink of the water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David. Nevertheless he would not drink it, but poured it out to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Far be it from me, O Jehovah, that I should do this! Should I drink the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their souls? Therefore he would not drink it. These things were done by the three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Abishai the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of another three. He lifted his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name among these three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Was he not the most honored of three? Therefore he became their commander. However, he did not attain to the first three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done many deeds. He had killed two from Moab that were like lions. He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he killed an Egyptian, a spectacular man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand; so he went down to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptians hand, and killed him with his own spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name among three mighty ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He was more honored than the thirty, but he had not attained to the first three. And David appointed him over his guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai from the brooks of Gaash,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Eliahba the Shaalbonite (of the sons of Jashen), Jonathan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite (armorbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
