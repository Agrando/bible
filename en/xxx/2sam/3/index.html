But David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widowed wife of Nabal the Carmelite; the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>the fourth, Adonijah, the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah, the son of Abital;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and the sixth, Ithream, by Davids wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now it was so, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my fathers concubine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Abner became very angry at the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dogs head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David as Jehovah has sworn to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Abner sent messengers on his behalf to David, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring around all Israel to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said, Good, I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I am asking of you: you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Sauls daughter, when you come to see my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Sauls son, saying, Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And her husband went along with her to Bahurim, weeping behind her. And Abner said to him, Go, return. And he returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the words of Abner had come to the elders of Israel, saying, In time past you were desiring David as king over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now then, do it! For Jehovah has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of My servant David, I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin. And Abner also went to speak in the ears of David at Hebron all that was good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of the house of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires. And David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoils with them. And Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Joab and all the troops that were with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner has come to the king, and he sent him away, and he has gone in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Joab came to the king and said, What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you sent him away, and he has left to go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You realize that Abner the son of Ner has come to deceive you, to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when Joab had left David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately, and there stabbed him in the stomach, so that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And afterward, when David heard it, he said, My kingdom and I are guiltless before Jehovah forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>May it whirl about on the head of Joab and on all his fathers house; and let there never fail to be in the house of Joab one who has a discharge or is a leper, who leans on a staff or falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, Tear your clothes, gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn for Abner. And King David walked behind the coffin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king lamented over Abner and said: Should Abner die the death of a fool?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Your hands were not bound nor your feet put into fetters; as a man falls before wicked men, so you have fallen. Then all the people wept over him again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when all the people came to give David food to eat while it was still day, David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And all the people took note of it, and it was good in their eyes, even as whatever the king had done was good in the eyes of all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been from the king, to kill Abner the son of Ner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the king said to his servants, Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too severe for me. Jehovah shall repay the evildoer according to his evil.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
