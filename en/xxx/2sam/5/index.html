And they anointed David king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem, to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, You shall not come in here; but the blind and the lame will repel you, thinking, David cannot come in here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. It is the City of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said on that day, Whoever climbs up by way of the water conduit let him strike down the Jebusites, the lame and the blind, who are hated by DavidÂ’s soul. Therefore they say, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the City of David. And David built all around from the fortifications and inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David went on and became great, and Jehovah the God of Hosts was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and craftsmen and masons. And they built David a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus David recognized that Jehovah had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted His kingdom for His people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron. Also more sons and daughters were born to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. And David heard of it and went down to the stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Philistines also went and spread themselves out in the Valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said to David, Go up, for I will deliver up to give the Philistines into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So David went to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, Jehovah has broken through my enemies before me, like water bursting forth. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the Philistines went up again and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And David inquired of Jehovah, and He said, You shall not go up; circle around behind them, and come upon them in front of the balsam trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, that you shall be decisive. For then Jehovah shall have gone out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David did so, as Jehovah had commanded him; and he struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
