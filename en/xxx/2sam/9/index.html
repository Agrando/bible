So when they summoned him to David, the king said to him, Are you Ziba? And he said, At your service!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said, Is there not still someone of the house of Saul, to whom I may show the kindness of God? And Ziba said to the king, There is still a son of Jonathan who is lame in his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then King David sent and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, had come to David, he fell on his face and prostrated himself.
