So it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David said to him, Where have you come from? So he said to him, I have escaped from the camp of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David said to him, How did the matter go? Please tell me. And he answered, The people have fled from the battle, many of the people have fallen and died, and Saul and Jonathan his son have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David said to the young man who told him, How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son have died?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the young man who told him said, As I happened by chance to be on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and horsemen closely pursued him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I answered, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said to me, Who are you? So I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to me again, Please stand over me and kill me, for agony has seized me because my soul still remains in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I stood over him and killed him, because I perceived that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then David took hold of his own clothes and tore them, and so did all the men with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son, for the people of Jehovah and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then David said to the young man who told him, Where are you from? And he answered, I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David said to him, How was it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the anointed of Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David summoned one of the young men and said, Go near, and fall upon him! And he struck him so that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David said to him, Your blood is on your own head, for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have killed the anointed of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he commanded them to teach the sons of Judah the Song of the Bow; behold, it is written in the Book of Jasher:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>O mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, nor fields of offerings; for the shield of the mighty has been rejected as loathsome there! The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan has not turned back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Saul and Jonathan were beloved and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they have not been separated. They have been swifter than eagles, they have been stronger than lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with luxury; who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan, slain on your high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan. You have been very pleasant to me; your love to me was wonderful, surpassing the love of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
