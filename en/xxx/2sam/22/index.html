my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; my Savior, You save me from violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised; thus shall I be saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When the waves of death surrounded me, the floods of ungodliness terrified me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>the sorrows of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>in my distress I called upon Jehovah, and cried out to my God; and He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry entered His ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the heavens quaked and were shaken, because He was angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Smoke went up from His nostrils, and devouring fire from His mouth; coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He bowed the heavens also, and came down with darkness under His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He rode upon a cherub, and flew; and He was seen upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He made darkness booths around Him, dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From the brightness before Him coals of fire were kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jehovah thundered from the heavens, and the Most High uttered His voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He sent out arrows and scattered them; lightning bolts, and He discomfited them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the channels of the sea were seen, the foundations of the world were uncovered, at the rebuke of Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of His nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent from above, He took me, He drew me out of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me; for they were too strong for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They confronted me in the day of my calamity, but Jehovah was my support.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He also brought me out into a broad place; He delivered me because He delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, and have not acted wickedly against my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all His judgments were before me; and as for His statutes, I did not turn aside from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I was also whole before Him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore Jehovah has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness before His eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the faithful You show Yourself kind; with a mighty man of integrity You show Yourself upright;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>with the pure You show Yourself pure; and with the perverse You show Yourself twisted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You save the lowly people; but Your eyes are upon the haughty, whom You bring down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For You are my lamp, O Jehovah; Jehovah causes my darkness to shine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For by You I run against a troop; by my God I leap over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As for the Mighty God, His way is perfect; the Word of Jehovah is proven; He is a shield to all who seek refuge in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For who is the Mighty God, except Jehovah? And who is a rock, except our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Mighty God is my refuge and strength, and He makes my way whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He makes my feet like the deer, and sets me on my high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He teaches my hands to do battle, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; Your affliction has made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>You enlarged my steps under me, so my feet have not slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them; and did not turn back until they were destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I destroyed and shattered them, so that they could not rise; they fell under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For You girded me with strength for battle; those rising against me You caused to bow under me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You have also given me the necks of my enemies, so that I annihilated those who hated me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They looked, but there was no one to save; even to Jehovah, but He did not answer them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; I pulverized them like the mire of the streets, and I stamped them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You also delivered me from the strivings of my people. You kept me as the head of the nations; a people I have not known serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Sons of foreigners cower before me; when they hear with the ear, they obey me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Sons of foreigners fade away, and are afraid in their holes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jehovah lives! Blessed is my Rock! Exalted is God, the Rock of my salvation!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>It is the Mighty God who avenges me, and brings down the peoples under me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He delivers me from my enemies. You also lift me up above those rising against me; You deliver me from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Therefore I give thanks unto You, O Jehovah, among the nations, and sing unto Your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He is the tower of salvation to His king, and shows mercy to His anointed, unto David and his seed forevermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
