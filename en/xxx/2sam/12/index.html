And he came to him, and said to him: There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The rich man had exceedingly many flocks and herds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished; and it grew up together with him and with his children. It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup and lay in his bosom; and it was like a daughter to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And a traveler came to the rich man, who spared to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare one for the wayfaring man who had come to him; but he took the poor mans lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Davids anger burned greatly against the man, and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah lives, the man who has done this is a son of death!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb, because he has done this thing and because he had no pity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Nathan said to David, You are the man! Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I gave you your masters house and your masters wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if that had been too little, I also would have given you this and that!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Why have you despised the Word of Jehovah, to do evil in His eyes? You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword; you have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the eyes of the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, before the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said to David, Jehovah also has put away your sin; you shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>However, because of this matter in which you have caused contempt, for Jehovah to be spurned by His enemies, the child also who is born to you shall die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Nathan departed to his house. And Jehovah struck the child that Uriahs wife had borne to David, and it became sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David therefore besought God for the child, and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the elders of his house arose and went to him, to raise him up from the ground. But he would not, nor did he eat food with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child had died. For they said, Behold, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not heed our voice. How can we tell him that the child has died? He may do some harm!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when David saw that his servants were whispering, David perceived that the child had died. Therefore David said to his servants, Has the child died? And they said, He has died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So David rose up from the ground, washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of Jehovah and prostrated himself. Then he went to his own house; and when he requested, they set food before him, and he ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then his servants said to him, What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child had died, you arose and ate food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said, While the child was alive, I fasted and wept; for I thought, Who knows whether Jehovah will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now he has died; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her and lay with her. And she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Now Jehovah loved him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and He sent word by the hand of Nathan the prophet: So he called his name Jedidiah, because of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and captured the royal city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and I have captured the city of waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now therefore, gather the rest of the people together and lay siege against the city and take it, lest I capture the city and it be called after my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, fought against it, and captured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he took their kings crown from his head. Its weight was a talent of gold, with precious stones. And it was set on Davids head. Also he brought out the spoils of the city in great abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he brought out the people who were in it, and put them under saws, iron picks and iron axes, and made them cross over into the brick kiln. Thus he did to all the cities of the people of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
