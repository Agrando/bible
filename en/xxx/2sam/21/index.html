And Jehovah answered, It is because of Saul and his bloody house, because he had killed the Gibeonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites. The children of Israel had sworn peace to them, but Saul had sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Gibeonites said to him, We will have no silver or gold from Saul or from his house, nor shall you kill any man in Israel for us. So he said, Whatever you say, I will do for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they answered the king, As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us, that we should be annihilated from remaining in any of the territories of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them before Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, whom Jehovah chose. And the king said, I will deliver them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath of Jehovah that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she had borne to Saul; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before Jehovah. So they fell, all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until the waters poured on them from the heavens. And she did not allow the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of Jabesh Gilead who had stolen them from the town square of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them up, after the Philistines had struck down Saul in Gilboa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there; and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin in Zelah, in the tomb of Kish his father. Thus they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Philistines were at war again with Israel. And David and his servants with him went down and fought against the Philistines; and David grew faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Ishbi-Benob, who was of the sons of the giants, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of bronze, who was bearing a new sword, intended to kill David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, You shall go out no more with us to battle, that you not quench the lamp of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it happened after this that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again there was war at Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed one from Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weavers beam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was born to the giants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when he reproached Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, Davids brother, killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These four were born to the giants in Gath, and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
