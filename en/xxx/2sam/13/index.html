Now Jonadab was a very shrewd man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he said to him, Why are you, the kings son, so low morning after morning? Will you not tell me? Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absaloms sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Jonadab said to him, Lie down on your bed and make yourself sick. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food, and prepare the food before my eyes, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Amnon lay down and made himself sick; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let Tamar my sister come and make a couple of cakes for me before my eyes, that I may eat from her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David sent to the house for Tamar, saying, Now go to your brother Amnons house, and prepare food for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Tamar went to her brother Amnons house; and he was lying down. Then she took flour and kneaded it, made cakes before his eyes, and baked the cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she took the pan and poured them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have everyone go out from me. And they all went out from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the inner room, that I may eat from your hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them to Amnon her brother in the inner room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me, for no such thing should be done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I, where could I take my shame? And as for you, you would be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>However, he would not heed her voice; and being stronger than she, he forced her and lay with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise and go!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she said to him, For what reason? This evil to send me away is worse than the other that you have done to me. But he would not listen to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he summoned his servant who attended him, and said, Send this woman out away from me, and bolt the door behind her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she had on a tunic of many colors, for the kings virgin daughters wore such robes. And his servant brought her outside and bolted the door behind her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her tunic of many colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head and went away, crying out as she went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now keep silent, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absaloms house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when King David heard of all these things, he was extremely furious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad. For Absalom hated Amnon, because he had humbled his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the kings sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Absalom came to the king and said, Behold, your servant has sheepshearers; please, let the king and his servants go with your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go now, lest we be a burden to you. And he pressed him, but he would not go, but blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Absalom said, If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Absalom pressed him; so he let Amnon and all the kings sons go with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Watch now, when Amnons heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Strike Amnon! then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and valiant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. And all the kings sons arose, and each one got on his mule and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, while they were on the way, that news came to David, saying, Absalom has killed all the kings sons, and not one of them is left!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the ground, and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah, Davids brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose they have killed all the young men, the kings sons, for only Amnon has died. For at the mouth of Absalom this has been determined since the day that he humbled his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore, let not my lord the king take this word to heart, to think that all the kings sons have died; for only Amnon has died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Absalom fled. And the young man who was keeping watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the way along the hillside behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jonadab said to the king, Look! The kings sons have come; according to your servants word, so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So it was, as soon as he had finished speaking, that behold the kings sons came, and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also the king and all his servants wept with a very great weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Absalom had fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Absalom had fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And King David longed to go to Absalom. For he had been comforted concerning Amnon, because he had died.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
