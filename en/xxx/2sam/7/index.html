And Jehovah has declared to you that He will make you a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When your days are fulfilled and you have rested with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the strokes of the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But My mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And your house and your kingdom shall be established forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>According to all these words and according to all this vision, thus Nathan spoke to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then King David went in and sat before Jehovah; and he said: Who am I, O Lord Jehovah? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And yet this was a small thing in Your eyes, O Lord Jehovah; and You have also spoken of Your servants house for a great while to come. Is this the manner of man, O Lord Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now what more can David say to You? For You, Lord Jehovah, have known Your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because of Your Word, and according to Your own heart, You have done all these great things, to make Your servant know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore You have been magnified, O Lord Jehovah. For there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And who is like Your people, like Israel, the one nation on the earth whom God has gone to redeem as a people for Himself, to make a name for Himself; and to do for Yourself great and awesome deeds for Your land, before Your people whom You have redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, the nations, and their gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For You established Your people Israel unto Yourself as Your own people forever; and You, Jehovah, have become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, O Jehovah God, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, establish it forever and do as You have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And let Your name be magnified forever, saying, Jehovah of Hosts is the God over Israel. And let the house of Your servant David be established before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For You, O Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, have disclosed this in Your servants ear, saying, I will build you a house. Therefore Your servant has found it in his heart to pray this prayer to You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, O Lord Jehovah, You are God, and Your Words are true, and You have promised this goodness to Your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now therefore, let it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You; for You, O Lord Jehovah, have spoken it, and with Your blessing let the house of Your servant be blessed forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
