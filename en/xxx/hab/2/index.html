Though it delays, wait for it, because it will come and take place; it will not tarry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, the soul of him who is puffed up is not upright; but the just shall live by his faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And also, wine indeed betrays a proud man, and he dwells not at home, who widens his soul like Sheol. And he is like death, and is not satisfied, but gathers all the nations to himself, and collects all the peoples to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Shall not all of these take up a parable against him, and a mocking riddle against him, and say, Woe to him who increases what is not his! How long, then, shall he load himself with many pledges?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Shall not those who bite you rise up suddenly, and those who vex you be aroused, and you become a booty to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because you have plundered many nations, all the rest of the people shall plunder you, because of the blood of men and the violence of the land, and the city, and all those dwelling in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Woe to him who robs unjust gain for his house, to set his nest on high, to be delivered from the hand of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You have advised shame for your house, to cut off many peoples, and have sinned in your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the stone shall cry out from the wall, and the beam shall answer it from the timbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Woe to him who builds a town with blood and establishes a city by iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, is it not of Jehovah of Hosts that the people labor only to feed the fire, and nations weary themselves only for vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe to him who causes his friend to drink, joining with your bottle, and also making him drunk, so as to look upon his nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You are filled with shame instead of glory; you drink also, and are counted as uncircumcised. The cup of the right hand of Jehovah shall turn on you, and disgrace shall be your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover you, and the devastation of beasts shall terrify them because of the blood of men and the violence of the land, the city, and all those that dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What does an image profit, that its maker should carve it; a molten image, and a teacher of falsehood, that the maker should trust in his work, to make mute idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe to him who says to the wood, Awake! To a mute stone, Rise up, it shall teach. Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, but there is no breath at all in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Jehovah is in His holy temple; let all the earth be silent before Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
