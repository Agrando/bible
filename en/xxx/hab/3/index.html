Jehovah, preserve Your work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make it known; in wrath remember compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>God comes from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His majesty covers the heavens, and His praise fills the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And His brightness is as the light; He has rays coming from His hand, and a covering of His strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A pestilence goes before Him, and lightning goes forth at His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He stood and measured the earth; He looked and shook nations; and the ancient mountains were scattered; the perpetual hills bowed down. His ways are eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I saw the tents of Cushan under wickedness; the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Was Jehovah furious against the rivers? Or was Your anger against the rivers? Or Your wrath against the sea; that You rode on horses, Your chariots of salvation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You bare Your bow naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even Your Word. Selah. You have divided the earth with rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The mountains saw You and writhed. The floods of water passed by. The deep uttered its voice and lifted up its hands on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The sun and moon stood still in their dwelling. At the light of Your arrows they went, at the shining of Your glittering spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You marched through the land in indignation. You threshed the nations in anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You went forth for the salvation of Your people, for the salvation of Your anointed. You struck the head from the house of the wicked by laying bare the foundation to the neck. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You thrust through with his own arrows the head of his villages. They came out in a rage to scatter me; their exultation was to devour the humble in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You trod in the sea with Your horses through the surging of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I heard, my body trembled; my lips quivered at the sound. Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled within myself, that I might rest in the day of distress. When he comes up against the peoples, he will attack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Though the fig tree shall not blossom, and fruit is not on the vines; the work of the olive fails, and the fields yield no food; the flock is cut off from the fold, and no herd is in the stalls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>yet I will exult in Jehovah; I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jehovah God is my strength, and He makes my feet like doesÂ’ feet, and He will make me to walk on my high places. To the chief singer, on Neginoth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
