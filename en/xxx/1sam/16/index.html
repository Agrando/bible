Fill your horn with oil, and go; I am sending you to Jesse the Bethlehemite. For I have provided Myself a king among his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Samuel said, How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer from the herd at your hand, and say, I have come to sacrifice unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will make known to you what you shall do; you shall anoint for Me the one I say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Samuel did what Jehovah spoke, and went to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled to meet him, and said, Do you come in peace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said, In peace. I have come to sacrifice unto Jehovah. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he consecrated Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came about, when they came, that he looked at Eliab and thought, Surely the anointed of Jehovah is before Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jehovah said to Samuel, Do not look at his appearance nor at the height of his stature, because I have refused him. For man does not see as He sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but Jehovah looks at the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, Jehovah has not chosen these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Samuel said to Jesse, Are all the young men here? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is grazing the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and bring him. For we will not sit down till he comes here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes, and good appearance. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is the one!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the Spirit of Jehovah had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah had fallen upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And SaulÂ’s servants said to him, Behold, an evil spirit from God is overwhelming you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let our lord now command your servants, who are before you, to seek out a man who knows how to play the harp; and it shall be that he shall play it with his hand when the evil spirit from God is upon you, and you shall be well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Saul said to his servants, Look now for a man who can play well, and bring him to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then one of the servants answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who knows how to play, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and Jehovah is with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by his son David to Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David came to Saul and stood before him. And he loved him greatly, and he became his armorbearer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Please let David stand before me, for he has found favor in my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And so it was, whenever the spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp and played with his hand; and Saul was relieved and well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
