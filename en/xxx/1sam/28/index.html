And Achish said to David, You recognize to understand that you shall go out with me to battle, you and your men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And David said to Achish, Surely you know what your servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore I shall make you guard over my head all the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, in his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the fortunetellers out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Philistines gathered together, and came and encamped at Shunem. So Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped at Gilboa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Saul inquired of Jehovah, Jehovah did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Saul said to his servants, Find me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at En Dor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went, and two men with him; and they came to the woman by night. And he said, Please divine for me by necromancy, and bring up for me the one I shall say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and fortunetellers from the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my soul, to cause me to die?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Saul swore to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah lives, no punishment shall befall you for this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the woman said, Whom shall I bring up for you? And he said, Bring up Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king said to her, Do not be afraid. What have you seen? And the woman said to Saul, I have seen a god-like one ascending out of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to her, What is his appearance? And she said, An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed down with his face to the ground and prostrated himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disturbed me to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am deeply distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me and does not answer me anymore, either by prophets nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, to make known to me what I should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Samuel said: Why then do you ask me, seeing Jehovah has departed from you and is your enemy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jehovah has done for Himself as He has spoken by my hand. For Jehovah has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because you have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah nor executed His fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore Jehovah has done this thing to you this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moreover Jehovah will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines. And tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me. Jehovah will also deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Saul quickly fell full length on the ground, and was greatly afraid because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no food all day or all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was exceedingly terrified, and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hands and heeded the words which you have spoken to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore, please, also listen the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a piece of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he refused and said, I will not eat. So his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he heeded their voice; and arose from the ground and sat on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she hastened to kill it. And she took flour and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And she brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose up and went away that night.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
