Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mountains of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent each man to his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the shofar throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And all Israel heard it said that Saul had struck a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel had also become odious to the Philistines. And the people were summoned after Saul at Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Philistines gathered together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude. And they came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth Aven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the men of Israel saw that they were in straits, for the people were distressed, then the people hid in caves, in crevices, in rocks, in holes, and in pits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, with all the people behind him, trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he waited seven days for Samuel, according to the appointed time; but Samuel had not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Saul said, Bring the burnt offering and peace offerings here to me. And he offered the burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it happened, as soon as he finished offering the burnt offering, that Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, to bless him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, When I saw that the people had scattered from me, and that you had not come at the appointed time, and that the Philistines were gathering together at Michmash,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then I said, The Philistines will now come down upon me at Gilgal, and I have not entreated the face of Jehovah. Therefore I forced myself, and offered a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of Jehovah your God, which He has commanded you. For now Jehovah would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But now your kingdom shall not stand. Jehovah has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and Jehovah has ordained him to be ruler over His people, because you have not kept what Jehovah has commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people found with him, about six hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Saul, Jonathan his son, and the people found with them remained at Gibeah of Benjamin; and the Philistines encamped at Michmash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned toward the way to Ophrah, to the land of Shual,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>another company turned toward the way to Beth Horon, and another company turned toward the way of the border overlooking the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines thought, Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But all Israel would go down to the Philistines to sharpen each manÂ’s plowshare, his mattock, his ax, and his sickle;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and the price for sharpening was a pim for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to set the points of the goads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So it came about, in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan. But they were found with Saul and Jonathan his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
