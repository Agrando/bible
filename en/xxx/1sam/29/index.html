And David and his men were passing over at the rear with Achish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the commanders of the Philistines said, What are these Hebrews doing here? And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, Is this not David, the servant of Saul king of Israel, who has been with me these days and years? And to this day I have found no fault in him since he defected to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him; so the commanders of the Philistines said to him, Make this fellow return, that he may go back to the place which you have appointed for him, and do not let him go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become our adversary. For with what could he make himself pleasing to his master, if not with the heads of these men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is this not David, of whom they sang in dances, saying: Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Achish summoned David and said to him, Surely, as Jehovah lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my eyes. For to this day I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me. Nevertheless you are not pleasing in the eyes of the rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore now, return and go in peace, that you may not do evil in the eyes of the rulers of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said to Achish, But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant as I have been before you to this day, that I should not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you are as good in my eyes as an angel of God; nevertheless the commanders of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now therefore, rise up early in the morning with your masterÂ’s servants who have come with you. And as soon as you are up early in the morning and have light, depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So David and his men arose early in the morning to depart, to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
