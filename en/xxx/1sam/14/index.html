But he did not tell his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Saul was sitting at the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron. The people who were with him were about six hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabods brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Jehovah at Shiloh, was wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines garrison, there was a sharp rock on one side and a sharp rock on the other side. And the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The one rock was a pillar northward opposite Michmash, and the other southward opposite Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jonathan said to the young man that was his armorbearer, Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that Jehovah will work for us; for nothing restrains Jehovah, to save by many or by few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So his armorbearer said to him, Do all that is in your heart. Turn then; behold, I am with you according to your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jonathan said, Behold, let us cross over to these men, and we will show ourselves to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If they say thus to us, Wait until we come to you, then we will stand still in our place and not go up to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up, for Jehovah has delivered them into our hand; and this will be a sign to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the men of the garrison called to Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will teach you something. And Jonathan said to his armorbearer, Come up after me, for Jehovah has delivered them into the hand of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet with his armorbearer after him; and they fell before Jonathan. And his armorbearer followed, killing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armorbearer made was about twenty men within an area of land half the size that a yoke of oxen might plow in a day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And there was trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and the raiders also trembled; and the earth quaked, so that it was a very great trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold the multitude had melted away; and they went, striking down one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Saul said to the people who were with him, Number and see who has gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Saul said to Ahijah, Bring the ark of God here (for the ark of God was with the sons of Israel that day).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it happened, while Saul spoke to the priest, that the roar in the camp of the Philistines continued to increase; so Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul and all the people with him assembled, and they went to the battle; and behold every mans sword was against his neighbor, and there was very great confusion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Moreover the Hebrews who had previously retreated from the Philistines into the surrounding areas, they also joined the camp of the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden in the mountains of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines had fled, they also pursued closely after them in the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Jehovah saved Israel that day, and the battle passed over to Beth Aven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the men of Israel were distressed that day, for Saul had placed the people under oath, saying, Cursed is the man who eats food until evening, before I have taken vengeance on my enemies. So none of the people tasted food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now all the people of the land came to a forest; and there was honey on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the people had come into the forest, there was the flowing honey; but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath; therefore he stretched out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then one of the people said, Your father adjured the people with an oath, saying, Cursed is the man who eats food this day. And the people were faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jonathan said, My father has troubled the land. See now, how my eyes have brightened because I have tasted a little of this honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How much better if the people had eaten to feed themselves today of the spoils of their enemies which they have found! For now would there not have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they drove back the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon; and the people were very faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the people rushed upon the spoils, and took sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and the people ate with the blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people are sinning against Jehovah to eat with the blood! So he said, You have dealt treacherously; roll a large stone to me this moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me here each man his ox and his sheep, slaughter them here, and eat; and do not sin against Jehovah to eat with the blood. So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night, and slaughtered it there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Saul built an altar unto Jehovah. This was the first altar that he built unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and plunder them until the morning light; and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever is good in your eyes. And the priest said, Let us draw near to God here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel? But He did not answer him that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Saul said, Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people, and know and see what this sin was today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For as Jehovah lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall be executed to death. But not one of all the people answered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then he said to all Israel, You be on one side, and my son Jonathan and I will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what is good in your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Therefore Saul said to Jehovah the God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken, but the people escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Saul said, Cast lots between my son Jonathan and me. And Jonathan was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. And Jonathan confessed to him, and said, I have tasted to eat a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Behold, I must die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Saul answered, God do so and more also; for you shall be executed to death, Jonathan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has accomplished this great deliverance in Israel? Let it not be! As Jehovah lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Saul withdrew from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies all around: against Moab, against the sons of Ammon, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he condemned them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he dealt with might and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The sons of Saul were Jonathan, Jishui and Malchishua. And the names of his two daughters: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>The name of Sauls wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Sauls uncle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And war with the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any strong man or any valiant youth, he gathered them to himself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
