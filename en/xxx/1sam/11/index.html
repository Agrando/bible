And then, if there is no one to deliver us, we will come out to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and spoke the words in the ears of the people. And all the people lifted up their voices and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And behold, Saul was coming behind the herd from the field; and Saul said, What is with the people, that they weep? And they recounted to him the words of the men of Jabesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger burned greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever does not come out with Saul and Samuel to battle, so it shall be done to his oxen. And the fear of Jehovah fell on the people, and they came out as one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he numbered them at Bezek, the sons of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said to the messengers who came, Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance. And the messengers came and reported it to the men of Jabesh, and they rejoiced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do with us whatever is good in your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So it was, the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp at the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day. And it happened that those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the people said to Samuel, Who is he who said, Shall Saul reign over us? Set forth the men, that we may put them to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Saul said, Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today Jehovah has worked deliverance in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Samuel said to the people, Come, let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal. There they slaughtered sacrifices of peace offerings before Jehovah, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
