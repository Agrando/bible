Now appoint us a king to judge us like all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the thing made SamuelÂ’s eyes quiver when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehovah said to Samuel, Consent to the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me, for Me to not reign over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even to this day, with which they have forsaken Me and served other gods, so they are doing to you also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now therefore, consent to their voice. However, you shall solemnly testify to them, and inform them regarding the manner of the king who shall reign over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So Samuel told all the words of Jehovah to the people who were asking him for a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, This shall be the manner of the king who shall reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them for his own chariots and to be his horsemen, and some will run before his chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He will appoint commanders over his thousands and commanders over his fifties, will set some to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and some to make his implements of war and equipment for his chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He will take a tenth of your seed and your vintage, and give it to his officers and servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he will take your male servants, your female servants, your finest young men, and your donkeys, and make them do his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He will take a tenth of your sheep. And you will be his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and Jehovah will not answer you in that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nevertheless the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, No, but there shall be a king over us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and spoke them in the ears of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehovah said to Samuel, Consent to their voice, and cause a king to reign over them. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Each of you go to his city.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
