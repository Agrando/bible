But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>David therefore sent out spies, and knew for sure that Saul had come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David rose up and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. And Saul was lying within the entrenchment, with the people encamped all around him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then David answered, and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joabs brother, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So David and Abishai came to the people by night; and behold Saul was lying down sleeping within the entrenchment, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the people were lying all around him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Abishai said to David, God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day. Now therefore, please, let me strike him with the spear, into the earth one time; and I will not strike him again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David said to Abishai, Do not destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against the anointed of Jehovah, and be guiltless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>David said furthermore, As Jehovah lives, Jehovah shall strike him, or his day shall come to have died, or he shall go out to battle and will have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the anointed of Jehovah. But please, take now the spear and the jug of water that are by his head, and let us go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So David took the spear and the jug of water by Sauls head, and they got away; and no man saw it or knew it or awoke. For they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Jehovah had fallen upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off, with a great distance between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Do you not answer, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are you, calling out to the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David said to Abner, Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy your lord the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This thing that you have done is not good. As Jehovah lives, you are sons of death, because you have not guarded your master, the anointed of Jehovah. And now see where the kings spear is, and the jug of water that was by his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul recognized Davids voice, and said, Is that your voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue his servant? For what have I done, or what evil is in my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore, please, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant: If Jehovah has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering. But if it is the sons of men, may they be cursed before Jehovah, for they have driven me out this day from joining in the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So now, do not let my blood fall to the earth before the face of Jehovah. For the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Saul said, I have sinned. Return, my son David. For I will harm you no more, because my soul was precious in your eyes this day. Indeed I have acted foolishly and erred exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David answered and said, Here is the kings spear. Let one of the young men come over and get it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>May Jehovah repay every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness; for Jehovah has delivered you into my hand today, but I would not stretch out my hand against the anointed of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And behold, as your soul has been magnified this day in my eyes, so let my soul be magnified in the eyes of Jehovah, and let Him deliver me out of all distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Saul said to David, May you be blessed, my son David! You shall bring about to do, and shall prevail to accomplish. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
