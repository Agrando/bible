And David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Davids men said to him, This is the day of which Jehovah has said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as is pleasing in your eyes. And David arose and secretly cut off the skirt of Sauls robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it happened afterward that Davids heart smote him because he had cut off Sauls skirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the anointed of Jehovah, to stretch out my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So David restrained his men with these words, and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. And Saul rose up from the cave and went on his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>David also rose up afterward, went out of the cave, and called out after Saul, saying, My lord the king! And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and prostrated himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David said to Saul: Why do you listen to the words of men who say, Behold David is seeking to hurt you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, this day your eyes have seen that Jehovah has delivered you today into my hand in the cave, and some had intended to kill you. But my eye spared you, and I said, I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he is the anointed of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover, my father, look! Indeed, see the skirt of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and did not kill you, recognize and consider that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against you. And yet you are hunting my soul to take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jehovah judge between you and me, and Jehovah avenge me of you. But my hand shall not be against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As the proverb of the ancients says, Wickedness proceeds from the wicked. But my hand shall not be against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom are you pursuing? After a dead dog? After a flea?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore Jehovah is judge, and has judged between you and me, and shall see and plead my case, and deliver me out of your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And so it was, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to David: You are more righteous than I; for you have rewarded me with good, whereas I have rewarded you with evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you have shown this day how you have dealt well with me; for when Jehovah had delivered me into your hand, you have not killed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away with good will? Therefore may Jehovah reward you with good for what you have done to me this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, behold, I know that you shall reign to be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore swear now to me by Jehovah that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name from my fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home, and David and his men went up to the stronghold.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
