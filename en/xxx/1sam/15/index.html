Now therefore, heed the voice of the words of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: I will punish Amalek for what he has done to Israel, how he had laid in wait for him on the way when he came up from Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them. But kill both man and woman, infant and nursing child, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Saul gathered the people together and mustered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. For you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah all the way to Shur, which is before Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He also took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and were unwilling to utterly destroy them. But everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Word of Jehovah came to Samuel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I regret that I have set up Saul as king, for he has turned back from following Me, and has not carried out My words. And it angered Samuel, and he cried out to Jehovah all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Samuel arose early in the morning to meet Saul, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul has come to Carmel, and behold, he is setting up a monument for himself; and he has gone on around, passed by, and gone down to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, Blessed are you of Jehovah! I have carried out the Word of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Samuel said, What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and the oxen, to sacrifice unto Jehovah your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Samuel said to Saul, Be quiet! And I will tell you what Jehovah has said to me last night. And he said to him, Speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel said, When you were little in your own eyes, were you not head of the tribes of Israel? And did not Jehovah anoint you king over Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now Jehovah sent you on a mission, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them to finish them off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then have you not obeyed the voice of Jehovah? Why did you swoop down upon the spoils, and do evil in the eyes of Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul said to Samuel, But I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and gone on the mission to which Jehovah sent me, and brought back Agag the king of Amalek; I have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the people took of the plunder, sheep and oxen, the best of the things, the devoted things, to sacrifice unto Jehovah your God in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel said: Has Jehovah as great a delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in to obey the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed than the fat of rams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the Word of Jehovah, He also has rejected you from being king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, for I have transgressed the mouth of Jehovah and your words, because I feared the people and heeded their voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now therefore, please forgive my sin, and return with me, that I may bow down before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you, for you have rejected the Word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected you from being king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as Samuel turned around to go away, Saul seized the edge of his robe, and it tore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samuel said to him, Jehovah has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also the Emminence of Israel will not deal falsely nor repent. For He is not a man, to repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, I have sinned; yet honor me now, please, before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may bow down before Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul bowed down before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Samuel said, Bring Agag king of the Amalekites here to me. So Agag came to him delighted; for Agag thought, Surely the bitterness of death has past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hacked Agag in pieces before Jehovah at Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Samuel went no more to see Saul until the day of his death. Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul, and Jehovah was sorry that He had made Saul king over Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
