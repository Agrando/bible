Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And this man went up from his city year after year to bow down and sacrifice unto Jehovah of Hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests unto Jehovah there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah, although Jehovah had closed up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her rival also provoked her to vexation, to make her tremble, because Jehovah had closed up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And so it was, year by year, when she went up to the house of Jehovah, that she provoked her; therefore she wept and did not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? And why does your heart quiver? Am I not better to you than ten sons?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hannah rose up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Jehovah and wept with weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she vowed a vow and said, O Jehovah of Hosts, if You will look to see the affliction of Your handmaid and remember me, and not forget Your handmaid, but will give Your handmaid a male child, then I shall give him unto Jehovah all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it happened, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli was watching her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Eli said to her, How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away from you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of intense spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not consider your handmaid for a daughter of worthlessness, for out of the abundance of my anxiety and vexation I have spoken until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition which you have asked of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Let your handmaid find favor in your eyes. So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they arose early in the morning and bowed down before Jehovah, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and Jehovah remembered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So it came to pass in the process of time that Hannah conceived and bore a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked for him from Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice and his vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah and remain there always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what is good in your eyes; wait until you have weaned him. Only may Jehovah establish His word. So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of Jehovah at Shiloh: the child, the boy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they slaughtered a bull, and brought the boy to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And she said, O my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here to pray unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this boy I prayed, and Jehovah granted me my petition which I have asked of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore I also have given him unto Jehovah; as long as he lives he is loaned unto Jehovah. And he bowed down before Jehovah there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
