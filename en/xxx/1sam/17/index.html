Am I not a Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Philistine said, I defy the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons. And the man was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The three oldest sons of Jesse went out after Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>David was the youngest, and the three oldest had gone after Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David went and returned from Saul to feed his fathers sheep at Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Philistine drew near and presented himself morning and evening, forty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesse said to his son David, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves, and run to your brothers at the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And carry these ten cuts of cheese to the commander of their thousand, and see how your brothers fare, and bring back news of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David arose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, and took the things and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the camp as the army was going out to the battle line and shouting for the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Israel and the Philistines had drawn up in battle array, rank against rank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David left the things in the hand of the supply keeper, ran to the army, and came and inquired after the welfare of his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as he talked with them, behold the man came out from the ranks of the armies of the Philistines, between the two armies, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name; and he spoke according to the same words. And David heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were very much afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man who comes up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel. And it shall be that the man who kills him, the king will enrich with great riches, will give him his daughter, and make his fathers house free from taxes in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the ranks of the living God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the people answered him in this manner, saying, Thus shall it be done for the man who kills him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliabs anger burned against David, and he said, Why did you come down here? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and your naughty heart, for you have come down to see the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And David said, What have I done now? Was it not just words?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he turned from him toward another and spoke the same words; and these people answered him according to the first words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when the words which David had spoken were heard, they were reported before Saul; and he sent for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And David said to Saul, Let no mans heart fail because of him; your servant shall go and fight with this Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And David said to Saul, Your servant was grazing his fathers sheep; and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I went out after it and struck it, and rescued the lamb out of its mouth; and when it arose against me, I took hold of it by its beard, and struck and killed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has reproached the ranks of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Moreover David said, Jehovah, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and Jehovah be with you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Saul clothed David with his garments, and he put a bronze helmet on his head, and clothed him with body armor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And David girded his sword to his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested them. And David said to Saul, I cannot walk with these, for I have not tested them. And David took them off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then he took his staff in his hand; and he chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the shepherds bag, in a pouch which he had, and his sling was in his hand. And he drew near to the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the Philistine proceeded to come near to David, with the man carrying the shield before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when the Philistine considered and saw David, he disdained him; for he was only a youth, ruddy and of good appearance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you are coming to me with sticks? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then David said to the Philistine, You are coming to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I am coming to you in the name of Jehovah of Hosts, the God of the ranks of Israel, whom you have reproached.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>This day Jehovah will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the heavens and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then all this assembly shall know that Jehovah does not save with sword and spear; for the battle is Jehovahs, and He has given you into our hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>So it was, when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, that David hastened and ran toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone; and he slung it and struck the Philistine in his forehead, so that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. But there was no sword in the hand of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Therefore David ran and stood over the Philistine, took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their strong man was dead, they fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the men of Israel and Judah rose up and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as the entrance of the valley and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell along the way to Shaaraim, even as far as Gath and Ekron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the sons of Israel returned from hotly pursuing the Philistines, and plundered their camps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now when Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>So the king said, Inquire whose son this young man is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>So when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And Saul said to him, Lad, whose son are you? And David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
