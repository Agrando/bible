But David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelechs son, Please bring the ephod here to me. And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake them? And He answered him, Pursue, for you shall reach to overtake them, and rescue to recover all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So David went, he and the six hundred men with him, and came to the Brook Besor, where those stayed who were left behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who had become too exhausted to cross over the Brook Besor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they found a man from Egypt in the field, and brought him to David; and they gave him bread and he ate, and they let him drink water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. So when he had eaten, his spirit revived; for he had eaten no bread nor drunk water for three days and three nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said to him, To whom do you belong, and where are you from? And he said, I am a young man from Egypt, servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me behind, because three days ago I fell sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We had raided the southern area of the Cherethites, in the territory of Judah, and the southern area of Caleb; and we had burned Ziklag with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David said to him, Can you bring me down to this troop? So he said, Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread out over the face of the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoils which they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David struck them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David rescued his two wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And nothing of theirs was lacking, either small or great, sons or daughters, spoils or anything which they had taken from them; David brought back all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David took all the flocks and herds they had driven before those other livestock, and said, This is Davids spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David came to the two hundred men who had become too exhausted to go after David, whom they also had made to stay at the Brook Besor. So they went out to meet David and to meet the people with him. And when David came near the people, he asked after their welfare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then all the wicked and worthless men of those who went with David answered and said, Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoils that we have recovered, except for every mans wife and children, that they may lead them away and depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But David said, My brethren, you shall not do so with what Jehovah has given to us, who has preserved us and delivered into our hand the troop that came against us into our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For who will heed you in this matter? But as his part is who goes down to the battle, so shall his part be who stays by the supplies; they shall share together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So it was, from that day forward; he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoils to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, Here is a present for you from the spoils of the enemies of Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to those in Bethel, to those in Ramoth of the South, to those in Jattir,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to those in Aroer, to those in Siphmoth, to those in Eshtemoa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>to those in Rachal, to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, to those in the cities of the Kenites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>to those in Hormah, to those in Chorashan, to those in Athach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men had traversed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
