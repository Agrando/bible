And all the house of Israel mourned after Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you are returning unto Jehovah with all your hearts, then put away the foreign gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts for Jehovah, and serve Him only; and He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So the children of Israel put away the Baals and Ashtaroth, and served Jehovah only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to Jehovah for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they gathered together at Mizpah, drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah. And they fasted that day, and said there, We have sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel had gathered together at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard of it, they were afraid before the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the sons of Israel said to Samuel, Do not cease to cry out unto Jehovah our God for us, that He may deliver us out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering unto Jehovah. And Samuel cried out unto Jehovah for Israel, and Jehovah answered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But Jehovah thundered with a loud noise upon the Philistines that day, and so confused them that they were smitten before Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and drove them back as far as below Beth Car.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, Thus far has Jehovah helped us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the Philistines were subdued, and they did not come anymore into the territory of Israel. And the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel recovered its territories from the hands of the Philistines. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he went from year to year on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and judged Israel in all those places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he returned to Ramah, for his home was there. There he judged Israel, and there he built an altar unto Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
