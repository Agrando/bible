There was not a more handsome person than he among the sons of Israel. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the donkeys of Kish, Sauls father, were lost. And Kish said to his son Saul, Please, take one of the servants with you, and arise, go search for the donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he passed through the mountains of Ephraim and through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, Come, let us return, lest my father leave the donkeys and become concerned about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to him, Behold now, there is a man of God in this city, and he is an honorable man; all that he speaks succeeds to come to pass. Now let us go there; perhaps he can show us the way that we should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Saul said to his servant, But behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread in our vessels is all gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the servant answered Saul again and said, Behold, I have here at hand one fourth of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he spoke thus: Come, let us go to the seer; for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Saul said to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as they went up the hill to the city, they met some young women going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they answered them and said, Yes, behold he is ahead of you. Hurry now; for today he has come to this city, because there is a sacrifice of the people today at the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As soon as you come into the city, you will surely find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now therefore, go up, for today you will find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So they went up to the city; and as they were coming into the city, behold, Samuel was coming out to meet them, to go up to the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now Jehovah had revealed in Samuels ear the day before Saul came, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him commander over My people Israel, that he may deliver My people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon My people, because their cry has come to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said to him, Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you. This one shall reign over My people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Please tell me, where is the seers house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel answered Saul and said, I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and tomorrow I will send you away and will declare to you all that is in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not set your heart on them, for they have been found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you and on all your fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul answered and said, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken this word to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and had them sit in the place at the head of those who were invited; which were about thirty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it beside you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set it before Saul. And he said, Behold here is what was reserved. Set it before you and eat; for until this appointed time it has been kept for you, since I said I invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they had come down from the high place into the city, he spoke with Saul on the top of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they arose early; and it was about daybreak that Samuel summoned Saul to the top of the house, saying, Arise, that I may send you away. And Saul arose, and both of them went outside, he and Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as they were going down to the city limits, Samuel said to Saul, Command the servant to go on ahead of us. And he went on. But you stand here a moment, that I may proclaim to you the Word of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
