and wither as the green herb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Trust in Jehovah, and do good; dwell in the land, and feed on faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Delight yourself also in Jehovah, and He shall give you the desires of your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Roll your ways upon Jehovah; trust also in Him, and He will bring it to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He will bring forth your righteousness like the light, and your justice like the noonday.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for Him; do not fret over him who prospers in his way, because of him who works out wicked devices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; do not fret; it only leads to evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For evildoers shall be cut off; but those who wait upon Jehovah, they shall inherit the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For yet a little while, and the wicked shall be no more; indeed, you shall diligently consider his place, and it shall be no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the lowly shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes at him with his teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovah laughs at him, for He sees that his day is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, to slaughter those who walk uprightly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little that the righteous has is better than the riches of many wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but Jehovah upholds the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehovah knows the days of the upright, and their inheritance shall be forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall not be ashamed in the evil time, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of Jehovah shall be as prized lambs; they are consumed; like smoke they vanish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The wicked borrows and does not repay, but the righteous shows mercy and gives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For those blessed by Him shall inherit the earth, and those cursed by Him shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The steps of a good man are ordered by Jehovah, and he delights in His way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Though he fall, he shall not be cast down, for Jehovah upholds his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have been young, and now am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All day long he is gracious and lends, and his seed is blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Depart from evil and do good, and live forevermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For Jehovah loves justice and does not forsake His Godly ones; they are preserved forever; but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The righteous shall inherit the earth, and dwell in it forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, and his tongue talks of justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jehovah will not abandon him in his hand, nor allow him to be found guilty when he is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wait upon Jehovah and keep His way, and He will lift you up to inherit the earth; when the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have seen the wicked, ruthless, and spreading himself like a luxuriant native tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Yet he passed away, and lo, he was no more; indeed, I sought for him, but he could not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Observe the perfect and consider the upright one; for the latter time of that man is peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But the transgressors shall be destroyed together; the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the salvation of the righteous is from Jehovah; He is their strength in the time of distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jehovah will help them and deliver them; He will deliver them from the wicked and save them, because they have trusted in Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
