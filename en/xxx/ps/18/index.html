my Mighty God, my rock wall, in whom I will trust; He is my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be delivered from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The cords of death have surrounded me, and the floods of the wicked made me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death have confronted me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In my distress I called upon Jehovah, and cried out to my God; He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry came before Him, into His ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the earth shook and trembled; and the foundations of the hills quaked and were shaken, because He was angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Smoke went up out of His nostrils, and fire devoured out of His mouth; coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He also bowed the heavens and came down, and darkness was under His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He rode upon a cherub, and soared; yea, He flew swiftly upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He made darkness His secret place; His pavilion around Him was dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From the brightness before Him, His dark clouds passed over with hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovah also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave forth His voice, hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yea, He sent out His arrows and scattered them; and He shot out lightnings and confounded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were uncovered at Your rebuke, O Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He sent from above, He took me, He drew me out of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me; for they were too strong for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They confronted me in the day of my calamity; but Jehovah was my support.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He brought me forth also into a broad place; He delivered me because He delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands He has given back to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For all His judgments were before me, and I did not put away His Statutes from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I was also perfect before Him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore Jehovah has given back to me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>With the merciful You will show Yourself merciful; with a perfect man You will show Yourself perfect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>with the pure You will show Yourself pure; and with the crooked You will show Yourself twisted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For You will save the lowly people, but will bring down lofty looks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For You will light my lamp; Jehovah my God will cause my darkness to shine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For by You I run against a troop; and by my God I leap over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As for the Mighty God, His way is perfect; the Word of Jehovah is tested; He is a shield to all those who trust in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For who is God besides Jehovah? Or, who is a Rock except our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It is the Mighty God who clasps me with strength and makes my way perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He makes my feet like the feet of deer, and sets me on my high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He teaches my hands to war, so that a bow of bronze is stretched by my arms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; and Your right hand has held me up, and Your meekness has made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You enlarged the place for my steps under me, so that my feet have not slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I have pursued my enemies and overtaken them; nor did I turn back until they were destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have shattered them, and they cannot rise again; they have fallen under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For You have clasped me with strength for the battle; You bowed down under me those who rose up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You have also given me the necks of my enemies; so that I annihilated those who hated me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They cried out for help, but there was no one to deliver; even to Jehovah, but He did not answer them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then I beat them fine as the dust before the wind; I cast them out like the dirt in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You have delivered me from the strivings of the people; You have made me the head of the nations; a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me; the children of foreigners shall cower before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The children of foreigners shall fall down and come trembling out of their holes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Jehovah lives! Blessed be my rock! Let the God of my salvation be exalted!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>It is the Mighty God who avenges me, and puts the people to flight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He delivers me from my enemies; yea, You lift me up above those who rise up against me; You have delivered me from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Therefore I will give thanks to You, O Jehovah, among the nations, and make music unto Your name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>who gives great deliverance to His king, and deals mercy to His anointed, to David and to his seed forevermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
