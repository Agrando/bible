Can He give bread also? Can He provide flesh for His people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore Jehovah heard this and was furious; so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>because they did not believe in God, and did not trust in His salvation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>though He had commanded the clouds above, and opened the doors of the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>had rained down manna upon them to eat, and given them of the grain of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Men ate the bread of the mighty; He sent them food to the full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens; and by His power He brought in the south wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He also rained flesh upon them like the dust, and winged birds like the sand of the seas;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and He let them fall into the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they ate and were abundantly satisfied, for He gave them their own desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They were not deprived of their lust; but while their food was still in their mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the wrath of God came upon them, and killed the fattest of them, and struck down the choice men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all this they still sinned, and did not believe in His wondrous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore He brought an end to their days in vanity, and their years in dismay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When He killed them, then they sought after Him; and they returned and sought earnestly for the Mighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then they remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God was the One who redeemed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Nevertheless they deceived Him with their mouths, and they lied to Him with their tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>for their heart was not steadfast with Him, nor were they faithful in His covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But He, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy them; yea, many a time He turned His anger away, and did not stir up all His wrath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>for He remembered that they were but flesh, a breath that passes away and does not come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How often they provoked Him in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yea, they turned back and tempted the Mighty God, and troubled the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They did not remember His hand, the day when He ransomed them from the enemy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>when He brought to pass His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the fields of Zoan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He also gave their crops to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He also gave up their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He cast upon them His burning anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, by sending evil angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He made a path for His anger; He did not spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the plague,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first of their strength in the tents of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But He made His own people go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and He led them on safely, so that they did not fear; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And He brought them to the border of His sanctuary, this mountain which His right hand had acquired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them an inheritance by a surveyors line, and made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God, and did not keep His Testimonies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>but turned back and acted unfaithfully like their fathers; they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For they provoked Him to anger with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>When God heard this, He was angry, and greatly despised Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>so that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He had placed among men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the enemys hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>He also gave His people over to the sword, and was angry with His inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>The fire consumed their young men, and their maidens were not given in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, like a mighty man overcome with wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And He struck His enemies; He put them to a perpetual reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Moreover He rejected the tent of Joseph, and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>but chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which He loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which He has founded forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He also chose David His servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>from following the ewes nursing their young He brought him, to shepherd Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
