for His mercy is eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They wandered in the wilderness in a desolate way; they found no city to dwell in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then they cried out unto Jehovah in their adversity, and He rescued them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city for a dwelling place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Oh, that men would give thanks unto Jehovah for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For He satisfies the longing soul, and fills the hungry soul with good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and irons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because they rebelled against the Words of the Mighty God, and despised the counsel of the Most High;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>therefore He humbled their heart with labor; they fell down, and there was no one to help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they cried out unto Jehovah in their adversity, and He delivered them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke and tore their bonds apart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Oh, that men would give thanks unto Jehovah for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For He has broken the gates of bronze, and cut the bars of iron in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Their soul abhors all kinds of food, and they draw near to the gates of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they cry out unto Jehovah in their adversity, and He delivers them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He sent His Word and healed them, and delivered them from the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Oh, that men would give thanks unto Jehovah for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare His works with rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business on great waters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>they see the works of Jehovah, and His wonders in the deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For He commands and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths; their soul melts because it is bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their witsÂ’ end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they cry out unto Jehovah in their adversity, and He brings them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He calms the storm, so that its waves are still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they are glad because they are quiet; so He guides them to their desired haven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Oh, that men would give thanks unto Jehovah for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people, and praise Him in the company of the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He turns rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into thirsty ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>a fruitful land into barrenness, because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He turns a wilderness into pools of water, and dry land into watersprings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>There He makes the hungry dwell, that they may establish a city for a dwelling place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and sow fields and plant vineyards, that they may yield a fruitful crop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He also blesses them, and they multiply greatly; and He does not let their cattle decrease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction and sorrow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He pours contempt upon nobles, and causes them to wander in the wilderness where there is no path;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>yet He exalts the poor out of affliction, and makes their families like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The upright see it and rejoice, and all iniquity stops its mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Whoever is wise will observe these things, and they shall understand the goodness of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
