Will You hide in times of distress?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The wicked in his pride persecutes the lowly; let them be caught in the plots that they have devised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For the wicked boasts of his heartÂ’s desire, and blesses those who plunder, whom Jehovah has spurned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Through the pride of his countenance the wicked do not seek after God; God is not in all his schemes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His ways are always twisted; Your judgments are high, out of his sight. As for all his enemies, he snorts at them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved; from generation to generation I shall not be in adversity!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are trouble and wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He sits in the lurking places of the villages; in the secret places he murders the innocent; his eyes are hidden against the unfortunate ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He lies in wait secretly, like a lion in his den.

O Mighty God, lift up Your hand! Forget not the lowly poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Why have the wicked spurned God? He has said in his heart, You will not investigate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But You have seen it, for You pay attention to trouble and provocation; to repay it with Your hand.
