I would fly away and be at rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Lo, I would wander far off; I would abide in the wilderness. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I would hasten my escape from the rushing wind and tempest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Swallow up, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Day and night they go around upon its walls; wickedness and trouble are also in its midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Lust is in its midst; oppression and guile do not depart from its streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is not an enemy who reproaches me, then I could bear it. It is not one who hates me who magnified himself against me, or I would hide myself from him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but it is you, a man my equal, my friend and acquaintance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We took sweet counsel together, and walked to the house of God in the throng.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let death seize them, and let them go down alive into Sheol; for evil is among them and in their dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for me, I will call upon God, and Jehovah will deliver me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Evening and morning and at noon I meditate and am in a stir; and He will hear my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He has delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; for there were many against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Mighty God will hear and testify to them, even He who abides from of old.
