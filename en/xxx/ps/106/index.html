O give thanks unto Jehovah, for He is good! For His mercy is eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah? Who can proclaim all His praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed are those who keep justice, and he who does righteousness at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor of Your people; O visit me with Your salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that I may see the good of Your elect, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, that I may glory with Your inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders; they did not remember the multitude of Your mercies, but rebelled by the sea; the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless He delivered them for His nameÂ’s sake, that He might make His mighty power known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so He led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He delivered them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The waters covered their enemies; there was not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they believed His Words; they sang His praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They soon forgot His works; they did not wait for His counsel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but lusted with desire in the wilderness, and tempted the Mighty God in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When they envied Moses in the camp, and Aaron the saint of Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the earth opened up and swallowed Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb, and bowed down to the molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus they changed their Glory into the image of an ox that eats grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgot the Mighty God their Deliverer, who had done great things in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>wondrous works in the land of Ham, awesome things by the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His elect stood before Him in the breach, to turn away His wrath, so that He should not destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His Word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but murmured in their tents, and did not heed the voice of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore He raised up His hand and swore against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to overthrow their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They joined themselves also to Baal-Peor, and ate sacrifices to the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thus they provoked Him to anger with their deeds, and the plague broke out upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was restrained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it was accounted to him for righteousness from generation to generation forevermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They angered Him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses on account of them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>because they rebelled against His Spirit, so that he spoke rashly with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not destroy the peoples as Jehovah had commanded them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but they mingled with the nations and learned their works;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>they served their idols, which were a snare to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thus they were defiled with their own works, and went whoring with their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against His people, so that He abhorred His own inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And He gave them into the hand of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were humbled under their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Many times He delivered them; but they rebelled in their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Nevertheless He regarded their affliction, when He heard their cry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and remembered His covenant toward them, and was moved to compassion according to the abundance of His mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He also gave them compassion before the faces of those who had taken them captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Deliver us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to Your holy name, to triumph in Your praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, Amen! Praise YAH!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
