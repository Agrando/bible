And behold the tears of the oppressed ones, and they had no comforter! And on the side of those who oppressed them there was power, but they had no comforter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore I congratulated the dead who already have died, more than the living who are still alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Yea, better than both is he who has never existed, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again, I considered all labor, and every successful work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbor. This also is vanity and striving of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The fool folds his hands together, and devours his own flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Better is a hand filled with rest than two hands full with travail and striving of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There is one alone, without a second; indeed, he has neither son nor brother; yet there is no end to all his labor; and his eyes are not satisfied with riches; and he does not ask, For whom do I labor and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity; indeed, it is an evil task.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if they fall, the one will lift up his companion; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, for he does not have another to help him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if one overpowers him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A poor and wise youth is better than an old and foolish king, who will not be admonished any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For he comes out of prison to reign; although in his kingdom he was poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I saw all the living who walk under the sun, with the second youth who stands in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There is no end of all the people, of all who have been before them; they also who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and striving of spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
