This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If a man begets a hundred, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, and his soul is not filled with goodness, and there is also for him no burial; I say, a miscarriage is better than he;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for it comes in with vanity and goes out in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Also it has not seen the sun, nor known anything.

This is also vanity and striving of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That which one is, he has been named already, and it is known that he is man. And he is not able to contend with Him who is mightier than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Since there are many things that increase vanity, how is man any better?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow? For who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
