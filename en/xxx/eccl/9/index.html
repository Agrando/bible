No man knows, whether by love or hatred, all that is before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>All happens alike to everyone; there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him who sacrifices, and to him who does not sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner. He who swears is as he who fears an oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event to all. Yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For whoever is chosen, of all those living, there is confidence; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For the living know that they shall die; but the dead do not know anything, nor do they have any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, have now perished; nor do they ever any longer have a part in anything that is done under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let your garments always be white; and let your head lack no ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Look on life with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life, which He has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity. For that is your share in this life, and in your labor which you labor under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might; for there is no work nor reasoning nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol where you go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happens to them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For man also does not know his time; as the fish that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This wisdom I have seen also under the sun, and it seemed great to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There was a little city with few men in it; and a great king came against it and besieged it, and built huge bulwarks against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a poor wise man was found in it, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no one remembered that poor man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I said, Wisdom is better than strength; but the poor manÂ’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The words of the wise are heard in quiet, more than the shouts of him who rules among fools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroys much good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
