And who knows the explanation of a thing? A mans wisdom makes his face shine, and the strength of his face is changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I say, Keep the kings edict, because of the oath of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do not be hasty to leave his presence. Do not take a stand in an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>because in the word of a king is power; and who may say to him, What are you doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Whoever keeps the command shall experience no evil decree; and a wise mans heart discerns both time and judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Because for every desire there is a time and judgment, for the evil of man increases greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For he does not know what shall be; so who can tell him when it shall be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>No one has power over the spirit to restrain the spirit; nor power in the day of death; and there is no discharge from that war; nor shall wickedness deliver its owners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>All this I have seen, and I gave my heart to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And so I saw the wicked buried, they who had come and gone from the consecrated place. And they were forgotten in the city where they had done so. This also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Though a sinner does evil a hundred times, and his days are prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But it shall not be well with the wicked, nor shall he prolong his days, which are like a shadow; because he does not fear before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There is a vanity which is done on the earth: There are just ones to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked ones to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I praised gladness, because a man has no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be glad; for that shall remain with him of his labor for the days of his life which God gives him under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth, not seeing sleep with the eyes, day or night;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>then I looked at all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun; because though a man labors to seek it out, yet he shall not find it. Moreover, though a wise one speaks of knowing, yet he shall not be able to find it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
