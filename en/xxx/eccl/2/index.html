I got men singers and women singers for myself, and the delights of the sons of men, wives and concubines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I did not withhold my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my share from all my labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and striving of spirit; and there was no profit under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I turned myself to consider wisdom and madness and folly; for what can the man do who comes after the king, when it has already been done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wise manÂ’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walks in darkness; and I also considered that one event happens to them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I said in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever, since that which is now shall all be forgotten in the days to come. And how does the wise man die? Same as the fool!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is done under the sun is evil to me; for all is vanity and striving of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yes, I hated all my labor which I had done under the sun; because I must leave it to the man who shall come after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he shall have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and acted wisely under the sun. This also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore I turned my heart to despair over all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and with success; yet he shall leave it as inheritance to a man who has not labored in it. This also is vanity and a great evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For what has man from all his labor, and from the striving of his heart, in which he has labored under the sun?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his days are sorrows, and his task grief; yea, his heart does not take rest in the night. This also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Is it not good for a man to eat and drink and make his soul behold the good in his labor. This also, I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For who can eat, or who can enjoy, apart from Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For God gives wisdom, and knowledge, and joy to a man who is good in His sight. But to the sinner He gives labor, to collect and gather, that he may give to him who is good before God. This also is vanity and striving of spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
