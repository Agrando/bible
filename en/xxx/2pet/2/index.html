They are presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But these, like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of the things they do not understand, and will utterly perish in their own corruption,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and will receive the wages of unrighteousness, as those who consider it pleasure to carouse in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, delighting in their own deceptions while they feast with you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls; having a heart exercised in covetousness; accursed children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but he was rebuked for his iniquity: a dumb donkey speaking with a manÂ’s voice restrained the madness of the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These are wells without water, clouds being driven by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through wantonness, the ones who have actually escaped from those living in error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the full true knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the end is worse for them than the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: A dog returns to his own vomit, and, a sow, having been washed, to her wallowing in the mire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
