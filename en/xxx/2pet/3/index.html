For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were since the beginning of creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For of this they are willfully ignorant: that by the Word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>by which the world that then existed perished, being flooded with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same Word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But, beloved, do not be unaware of this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, as some count slowness, but is longsuffering toward us, not purposing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with intense burning; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, of what sort ought you to be in holy behavior and godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>looking for and earnestly hastening unto the coming of the Day of God, through which the heavens will be dissolved, being set on fire, and the elements will melt with intense burning?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and without blemish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and consider that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable twist, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You therefore, beloved, since you know this beforehand, beware also that you not be led away with the error of the wicked, and fall from your own steadfastness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and forever. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
