For those serving, once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore, when He came into the world, He said: Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You did not take pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I said, Behold, I have come (in the volume of the book it is written of Me) to do Your will, O God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Previously saying, Sacrifice and offering, burnt offerings, and offerings for sin You did not desire, nor were pleased with them (which are offered according to the Law),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>then He said, Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God. He takes away the first in order that He may establish the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>from that time onward waiting till His enemies are made His footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My Laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>then He adds, Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>by a new and living way which He consecrated for us, through the veil; that is, His flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and having a High Priest over the house of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let us hold fast the confession of the hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting; and so much the more as you see the Day drawing near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For if we sin willfully after we have received the full true knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation which will devour those who oppose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Anyone who rejected MosesÂ’ Law dies without mercy before two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled on the Son of God, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of Grace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know Him who has said, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge His people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But remember the former days in which, after you were given understanding, you endured a great struggle with afflictions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>indeed while you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions, and also while you became companions of those who were so treated;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>for you had compassion on me in my bonds, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your goods, knowing, yourselves, that you have a better and an enduring possession in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For yet a little while, and He who is coming will come and will not linger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now the just shall live by faith; but if anyone draws back, My soul is not pleased with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But we are not of those who draw back to destruction, but of those who believe to the preserving of the soul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
