For He Himself has said, By no means will I ever leave you nor ever forsake you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So we may boldly say: The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember those in authority over you, who have spoken the Word of God to you. Observing the outworkings of their behavior, imitate their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines. For it is good that the heart be established by grace, not with foods which have not profited those who have been occupied with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered outside the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore let us go forth to Him, outside the camp, bearing His reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For here we have no continuing city, but we seek the one to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, confessing to His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Obey those in authority over you, and be submissive, for they watch out for your souls, as those who must give account. Let them do so with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray for us; for we are confident that we have a good conscience, in all things desiring to live honorably.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I especially urge you to do this, that I may be restored to you more quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now may the God of peace who brought up our Lord Jesus from the dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>make you complete in every good work to do His will, working in you what is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I appeal to you, brethren, endure the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Know that our brother Timothy has been set free, with whom I shall see you if he comes shortly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Greet all those in authority over you, and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Grace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
