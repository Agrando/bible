And he went out, not understanding where he was going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed, and she bore a child when she was past the age, because she judged Him faithful who had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born as many as the stars of the sky in multitude; innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off were assured of them, embraced them and confessed that they were foreigners and pilgrims on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And truly if they had called to mind that place from which they had come out, they would have had opportunity to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now they reach forth to a better, that is, a heavenly place. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>of whom it was said, In Isaac your Seed shall be called,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>reckoning that God had the power to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and did homage on the top of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a proper male child; and they were not afraid of the kings decree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaohs daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn should not touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith they crossed over the Red Sea as through dry land, whereas the Egyptians, attempting to do so, were swallowed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were encircled for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah, also of David and Samuel and the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became mighty in battle, turned to flight the armies of foreigners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Women received their dead raised to life again. And others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Still others had trial of mockings and floggings, yes, and of bonds and imprisonment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned, they were sawn in two, were tried, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, oppressed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, in dens and caves of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And all these, having borne witness through faith, did not obtain the promise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>God having provided something better for us, that they should not be made complete apart from us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
