For in that He put all things in subjection under him, He left nothing that is not put under him. But at this time we do not yet see all things subjected under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we see Jesus, who was made a little less than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Author of their salvation complete through sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all of one, for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying: I will declare Your name to My brethren; in the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again: I will put My trust in Him. And again: Here am I and the children whom God has given Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and set free those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For indeed He does not take on the form of angels, but He does take on the seed of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in the things pertaining to God, in order to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in that He Himself has suffered, being tested, He is able to help those who are tested.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
