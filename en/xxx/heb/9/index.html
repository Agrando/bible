Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now when these things had been thus prepared, the priests always went into the first tabernacle, performing the services.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But into the second the high priest went alone once a year, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins of the people, committed in ignorance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the Holy Spirit signifying by this that the way into the Holy of Holies was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It was a comparison for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make him who performed the service perfect in regard to the conscience;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>concerned only with foods and drinks, various washings, and fleshly ordinances imposed until the time when things were set right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Christ came as High Priest of the good things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Holy of Holies once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And for this reason He is the Mediator of the new covenant, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, that those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where there is a covenant, it is a necessity to announce the death of the one making the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For a covenant is in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the one who made the covenant is alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore neither was the first covenant dedicated without blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And according to the Law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore it was necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens should be purified with these, but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true, but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the Holy of Holies every year with blood of others;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now, once for all, at the end of the ages, He has been manifested to put away sin through the sacrifice of Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this the judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, without sin, unto salvation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
