Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they indeed for a few days disciplined us as seemed best to them, but He for our profit, that we may be partakers of His holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>watching carefully that no one fall short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springing up cause trouble, and through this many become defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>that there be no prostitute or profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food gave away his birthright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For you have not come to the mountain that may be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness and darkness and tempest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, so that those who heard it begged that the word should not be spoken to them anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(For they could not endure what was commanded: And if so much as a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned or shot with an arrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And so formidable was the sight that Moses said, I am in terror and trembling.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the Heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable multitude of angels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>to the gathering and assembly of the firstborn who are registered in Heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made complete,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See to it that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape who refused Him who spoke on earth, much more shall we not escape if we turn away from the One speaking from Heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now this, Yet once more, indicates the removal of those things that are being overthrown, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be overthrown may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For our God is a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
