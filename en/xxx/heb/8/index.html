Therefore it is necessary that this One also have something to offer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the Law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>who serve the copy and shadow of the Heavenly things, as Moses was divinely admonished when he was about to make the tabernacle. For He said, See that you make all things according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if that first had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because finding fault with them, He says: Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant, and bring fulfillment to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in My covenant, and I did not regard them, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will give My Laws into their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they shall not each one teach his neighbor, and each one his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for every one shall know Me, from the least of them to their great ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds I will by no means remember any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In that He says, New, He has made the first old. Now what is becoming worn out and growing old is ready to disappear.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
