And how do you see it now? When compared to it, is it not as nothing in your eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, says Jehovah. And be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. And be strong, all you people of the land, and work, says Jehovah. For I am with you, says Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>According to the Word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, so My Spirit stands among you; do not fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Yet once more (it is a little while), and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will shake all the nations; and the desire of all nations shall come. And I will fill this house with glory, says Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, says Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, says Jehovah of Hosts. And in this place I will give peace, says Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Jehovah came to Haggai the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Now ask the priests the Law, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If one carries holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and touches his skirt to the bread, or boiled food, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Haggai said, If an unclean body touches these, is it unclean? And the priests answered and said, It is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Haggai answered and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before Me, declares Jehovah. And so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now set your heart on it, from this day and onward: before the placing of a stone on a stone in the temple of Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>since those days, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty from the wine trough, there were but twenty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I struck you with blight, and with mildew, and with hail, in all the labors of your hands; yet you did not turn to Me, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now set your heart from this day and forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day that the foundation of JehovahÂ’s temple was laid. Consider in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Is the seed still in the barn? As yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not brought forth. From this day I will bless them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again the Word of Jehovah came to Haggai, in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Speak to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. And I will overthrow the chariots and their riders, and the horses and their riders will come down, each one by the sword of his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In that day, says Jehovah of Hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, says Jehovah, and will make you like a signet; for I have chosen you, declares Jehovah of Hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
