His mothers name was Hephzibah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah had cast out before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; he raised up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as Ahab king of Israel had done; and he bowed down to all the host of the heavens and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He also built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which Jehovah had said, In Jerusalem I will put My name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he built altars for all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He also made his son pass through the fire, practiced witchcraft and fortunetelling, and consulted necromancers and mediums. He did much evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he set a graven image in the grove that he had made, in the house of which Jehovah had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I have given to their fathers; only if they take heed to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the Law that My servant Moses has commanded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they have paid no attention, and Manasseh caused them to err, to do more evil than the nations whom Jehovah had destroyed before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jehovah spoke by His servants the prophets, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations (he has acted more wickedly than all the Amorites who were before him, and has also made Judah sin with his idols),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>therefore thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I shall stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab; I shall wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it face down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus I will forsake the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become spoils and plunder to all their enemies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>because they have done evil in My eyes, and have provoked Me to anger since the day their fathers had come out of Egypt, even to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to the other, besides his sin by which he made Judah sin, to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh; all that he did, and the sin that he sinned; are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Manasseh rested with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. And his son Amon reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, as his father Manasseh had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus he walked in all the ways that his father had walked; and he served the idols that his father had served, and bowed down to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He forsook Jehovah the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the servants of Amon conspired against him, and killed the king in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the people of the land struck all those conspiring against King Amon. And the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza. And Josiah his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
