And the creditor is coming to take my two children to be his slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house? And she said, Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a flask of oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then he said, Go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors; empty vessels; do not gather just a few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; and pour it into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured it out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me another vessel. And he said to her, There is not another vessel. And the oil stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then she came and reported to the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a notable woman, and she prevailed upon him to eat food. So it was, as often as he passed by, he would turn aside there to eat food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she said to her husband, Behold now, I know that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Please, let us make a small walled upper room; and let us put a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; and it shall be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn aside there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the day came that he came there, and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to Gehazi his servant, Summon this Shunammite. And when he had summoned her, she stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have been concerned for us with all this care. What shall I do for you? Shall I speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army? She answered, I am dwelling among my own people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Truly, she has no son, and her husband is old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, Summon her. When he had summoned her, she stood in the doorway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, At the appointed time according to the time of life you shall embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord. Man of God, do not lie to your maidservant!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the woman conceived and bore a son at the appointed time, according to the time of life, as Elisha had spoken to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When the child was grown, it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to his father, My head, my head! So he said to a servant, Carry him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door upon him, and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And she called to her husband, and said, Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, Why are you going to him today? It is neither the new moon nor the sabbath. And she said, It will be well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Lead on and go; do not slacken the pace for me unless I say so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So she departed, and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. And so it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, Behold, the Shunammite!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Please run now to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when she came to the man of God at the hill, she took hold of his feet; and Gehazi came near to push her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is bitter, and Jehovah has hidden it from me, and has not told me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And she said, Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say, Do not deceive me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him; but lay my staff on the face of the boy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the mother of the boy said, As Jehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So he arose and went after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Gehazi went on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the boy; but there was neither voice nor hearing. Therefore he went back to meet him, and reported to him, saying, The boy has not awakened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when Elisha came into the house, behold, the boy was dead, lying on his bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So he went in, shut the door behind the two of them, and prayed unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands; and he stretched himself out on the child, and the flesh of the child became warm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He returned and walked back and forth in the house, and again went up and stretched himself out on him; then the boy sneezed seven times, and the boy opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he summoned Gehazi and said, Summon this Shunammite. So he summoned her. And when she came in to him, he said, Take up your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground, and took up her son and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Elisha returned to Gilgal. Now there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, Put on the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And one of them went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, though they did not know what they were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they poured out for the men to eat. And it happened, as they were eating the stew, that they cried out and said, Man of God, there is death in the pot! And they could not eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So he said, Then bring some flour. And he put it into the pot, and said, Pour it out for the people, that they may eat. And there was nothing harmful in the pot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And a man came from Baal Shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley bread, and fresh heads of grain in his sack. And he said, Give it to the people, that they may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But his servant said, What? Shall I set this before one hundred men? He said again, Give it to the people, that they may eat; for thus says Jehovah: They shall eat and have some left over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So he set it before them; and they ate and had some left over, according to the Word of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
