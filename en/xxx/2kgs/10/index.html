And Jehu wrote and sent letters to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to those rearing Ahabs sons, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your masters sons are with you, and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and weapons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>choose the best and most upright of your masters sons, set him on his fathers throne, and fight for your masters house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings have not stood before him; how then can we stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he who was over the house, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those rearing the sons, sent to Jehu, saying, We are your servants, we will do all you tell us; but we will not make anyone king. Do what is good in your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he wrote a second letter to them, saying: If you are for me and will obey my voice, take the heads of the men, your masters sons, and come to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow. Now the kings sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were rearing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So it was, when the letter came to them, that they took the kings sons and slaughtered seventy persons, put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And a messenger came and reported to him, saying, They have brought the heads of the kings sons. And he said, Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came about in the morning, that he went out and stood, and said to all the people, You are righteous. Behold, I have conspired against my master and killed him; but who killed all these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Know now that nothing has fallen to the earth of the Word of Jehovah which Jehovah has spoken concerning the house of Ahab; for Jehovah has done what He has spoken by the hand of His servant Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and his acquaintances and his priests, until he left him no one remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he arose and departed and went to Samaria. On the way, at the house of the shepherds at Beth Eked,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehu met the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are you? And they answered, We are the brothers of Ahaziah; we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, Take them alive! So they took them alive, and killed them at the well of Beth Eked, forty-two men; and he left none of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab, coming to meet him; and he blessed him and said to him, Is your heart upright, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. Jehu said, If it is, give me your hand. So he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in his chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he came to Samaria, he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed them, according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken to Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little, Jehu shall serve him much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore, call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests. Let no one be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is missing shall not live. But Jehu acted with cunning, in order to destroy those serving Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehu said, Consecrate a solemn assembly to Baal. So they proclaimed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all those serving Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. So they came into the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was full from one end to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to the one over the wardrobe, Bring out the vestments for all those serving Baal. So he brought out vestments for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab went into the house of Baal, and said to those serving Baal, Search and see that no servants of Jehovah are here with you, but only those serving Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men outside, and had said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escapes, whoever lets him escape, it shall be his soul for the soul of the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now it happened, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the runners and the officers, Go in and strike them; let no one come out! And they killed them with the edge of the sword; then the runners and the officers threw them out, and went into the city of the house of Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they brought the sacred pillars out of the house of Baal and burned them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then they broke down the sacred pillar of Baal, and tore down the house of Baal and made it an outhouse to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>However Jehu did not turn away from after the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin, that is, from the golden calves that were at Bethel and Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jehovah said to Jehu, Because you have done well in doing what is right in My eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in My heart, your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Jehu took no heed to walk in the Law of Jehovah the God of Israel with all his heart; for he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In those days Jehovah began to cut off Israel; and Hazael struck them in all the territory of Israel</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>from the Jordan eastward: all the land of Gilead; Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh; from Aroer, which is by the River Arnon, including Gilead and Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So Jehu rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the days that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria were twenty-eight years.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
