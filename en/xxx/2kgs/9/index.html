And when you have brought him to an inner room,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>take the flask of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus says Jehovah: I have anointed you king over Israel. And when you have opened the door and fled, do not delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he came in, behold, the commanders of the army were sitting. And he said, I have a message for you, commander. And Jehu said, For which one of us? And he said, For you, commander.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he arose and went into the house. And he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: I have anointed you king over the people of Jehovah, over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah, at the hand of Jezebel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I shall cut off from Ahab all those who urinate against a wall in Israel, both bond and free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus I shall make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The dogs shall eat Jezebel on the plot of ground at Jezreel, for there shall be no one to bury her. And he opened the door and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and one of them said to him, Is all well? Why did this madman come to you? And he said to them, You know the man and his talk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they said, A lie! Tell us now. So he said, Thus and thus he has spoken to me, saying, Thus says Jehovah: I have anointed you king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then each man hastened to take his garment and put it under him on the top of the steps; and they blew the shofar, saying, Jehu is king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had been defending Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, against Hazael king of Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to be healed from the wounds with which the Syrians had struck him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If you are so minded, let no one leave or escape from the city to go and report it in Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jehu rode and went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there; and Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now a watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a multitude. And Joram said, Get a horseman and send him to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So the horseman went to meet him, and said, Thus says the king: Is it peace? And Jehu said, What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me. So the watchman reported, saying, The messenger went to them, but has not returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he sent out a second horseman who came to them, and said, Thus says the king: Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the watchman reported, saying, He went up to them and has not returned; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives madly!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu, and met him on the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? So he answered, What peace, as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft are so many?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Joram turned his hands and fled, and said to Ahaziah, Treachery, O Ahaziah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jehu drew his bow with full strength and shot Jehoram between his arms; and the arrow came out at his heart, and he sank down in his chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Jehu said to Bidkar his officer, Pick him up, and throw him into the parcel of the land of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when you and I were riding together behind Ahab his father, that Jehovah had laid this burden upon him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, says Jehovah, and I will repay you in this plot, says Jehovah. Now therefore, take and throw him on the plot of ground, according to the Word of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu pursued him, and said, Strike him also in the chariot, at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And his servants carried him in the chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the City of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now when Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she put black paint on her eyes and adorned her head, and looked down through a window.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as Jehu had entered at the gate, she said, Is it peace, Zimri, murderer of your master?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? Who? And two or three officials looked down at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said, Throw her down! So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses; and he trampled her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when he came in, he ate and drank. Then he said, Go now, see to this accursed woman, and bury her, for she was a kingÂ’s daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore they came back and reported to him. And he said, This is the Word of Jehovah, which He has spoken by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and the corpse of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the land, in the plot at Jezreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
