And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed a certain officer to her, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the proceeds of the fields from the day that she left the land until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Elisha came to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Syria was sick; and it was reported to him, saying, The man of God has come here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in your hand, and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of Jehovah by him, saying, Shall I remain alive of this disease?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hazael went to meet him and took a present with him, of every good thing of Damascus, forty camel-loads; and he came and stood before him, and said, Your son Ben-Hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, Shall I remain alive of this disease?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, You shall live to remain alive. However Jehovah has shown me that he shall die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he stood still and set his face until he was ashamed; and the man of God wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Hazael said, Why is my lord weeping? He answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: Their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will kill with the sword; and you will dash their children, and rip open their women with child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Hazael said, But what is your servant; a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, Jehovah has shown me that you will become king over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, What did Elisha say to you? And he answered, He told me that you will live to remain alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But it happened on the next day that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water, and spread it over his face so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat having been king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat began to reign as king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet Jehovah would not destroy Judah, for the sake of his servant David, as He had promised him to give a lamp to him and his sons all their days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In his days Edom revolted against the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him. And he rose up by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus Edom has been in revolt against the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Joram rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. And Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His motherÂ’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri, king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, like the house of Ahab, for he was the son-in-law to the house of Ahab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians struck Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then King Joram went back to Jezreel to be healed from the wounds with which the Syrians had struck him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
