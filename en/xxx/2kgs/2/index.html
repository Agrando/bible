But Elisha said, As Jehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you! So they went down to Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, Do you know that Jehovah will take away your master from over you today? And he said, Yes, I know; keep silent!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Elijah said to him, Elisha, stay here, please, for Jehovah has sent me on to Jericho. But he said, As Jehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you! So they came to Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, Do you know that Jehovah will take away your master from over you today? And he answered, Yes, I know; keep silent!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Elijah said to him, Stay here, please, for Jehovah has sent me on to the Jordan. But he said, As Jehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you! So the two of them went on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood in view of them at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water; and it was divided this way and that, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And so it was, when they had crossed over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask! What shall I do for you, before I am taken away from you? And Elisha said, Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened as they continued on and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire appeared with horses of fire, and separated the two of them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Elisha was watching and crying out, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen! So he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, Where is Jehovah the God of Elijah? And when he also had struck the water, it was divided this way and that; and Elisha crossed over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the sons of the prophets from Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they said to him, Behold now, there are fifty strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your master, lest perhaps the Spirit of Jehovah has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley. And he said, You shall not send.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they pressed him till he was ashamed, he said, Send! So they sent fifty men, and they searched for three days but did not find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they came back to him (for he had stayed in Jericho), he said to them, Did I not say to you, Do not go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the ground barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it. So they brought it to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he went out to the spring of the water, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus says Jehovah: I have healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus the waters remain healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some little boys came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he turned around and looked at them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And two bears came out of the forest and ripped apart forty-two of the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
