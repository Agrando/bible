His mothers name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days in which Jehoiada the priest had instructed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the consecrated things that are brought into the house of Jehovah, each mans poll tax money, each mans valuation money, and all the money that a man purposes in his heart to bring into the house of Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>let the priests take it themselves, each from his acquaintance; and let them repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach is found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But it was so, by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, that the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests, and said to them, Why have you not repaired the breaches of the house? Now therefore, do not take more money from your acquaintances, but give it for repairing the breaches of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the priests agreed that they would neither receive more money from the people, nor repair the breaches of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehoiada the priest took a chest, bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of Jehovah; and the priests who kept the door put there all the money brought into the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So it was, whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the kings scribe and the high priest came up and put it in bags, and counted the money that was found in the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they gave the money, which had been weighed out, into the hands of those doing the work, who had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and they brought it out to the craftsmen and builders who worked on the house of Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and to masons and stonecutters, and for buying timber and hewn stone, to repair the breaches of the house of Jehovah, and for all that was brought out to make the house strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However there were not made for the house of Jehovah basins of silver, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, any articles of gold or articles of silver, from the money brought into the house of Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for they gave it towards the business of doing the work, to restore the house of Jehovah with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover they did not require an accounting from the men into whose hands they gave the money to give to the workmen, for they were dealing faithfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The money from the trespass offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of Jehovah. It belonged to the priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath, and took it; and then Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehoash king of Judah took all the consecrated things that his fathers, Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, kings of Judah, had set apart, and his own consecrated things, and all the gold found in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah and in the kings house, and sent them to Hazael king of Syria. Then he went away from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And his servants rose up and conspired treason, and killed Joash in the house of the Millo, which goes down to Silla.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Jozachar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him. So he died, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. And Amaziah his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
