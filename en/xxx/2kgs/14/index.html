His mothers name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, yet not like his father David; he did everything as his father Joash had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>However the high places were not taken away, and the people were still sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it happened, as soon as the kingdom had been secured in his hand, that he struck his servants who had killed his father the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the children of the murderers he did not execute, according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, in which Jehovah had commanded, saying, Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers; but a person shall be put to death for his own sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and took Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You have attacked to strike Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Glory in that, and stay at your house; why stir yourself up over evil so that you fall, you and Judah with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Amaziah would not listen. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went out; so he and Amaziah king of Judah looked each other in the face at Beth Shemesh of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Judah was struck down before Israel, and every man fled to his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh; and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate; four hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he took all the gold and silver, all the articles that were found in the house of Jehovah and in the treasuries of the kings house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did; his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah; are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jehoash rested with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they conspired treason against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they brought him on horses, and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, became king in Samaria, and reigned forty-one years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the Word of Jehovah the God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet who was from Gath Hepher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Jehovah saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter; and whether bond or free, there was no helper for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jehovah had not spoken to blot out the name of Israel from under the heavens; but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did; his might, how he made war, and how he recovered for Israel from Damascus and Hamath what had belonged to Judah; are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So Jeroboam rested with his fathers, the kings of Israel. And Zechariah his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
