And he made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the house of Jehovah, and showed them the kings son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he commanded them, saying, This is what you shall do: One-third of you who come on the Sabbath shall be keeping watch over the kings house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>one-third shall be at the gate of Sur, and one-third at the gate behind the runners. You shall keep the watch of the house by turns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The two parts of you who go out on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of Jehovah for the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within range, let him be put to death. You shall be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus the commanders of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each of them took his men who were going in on the Sabbath, with those who were going out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the priest gave the commanders of hundreds the spears and shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the runners stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, all around the king, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he brought out the kings son, put the crown on him, and gave him the Testimony; they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, Long live the king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when Athaliah heard the sound of the runners and the people, she came to the people in the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when she looked, behold, the king was standing by the pillar according to the custom; and the rulers and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. So Athaliah tore her clothes and cried out, Treason! Treason!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jehoiada the priest commanded the commanders of the hundreds, those mustering the army, and said to them, Take her outside from the ranks of the house, and whoever follows after her, slay with the sword. For the priest had said, Do not let her be killed in the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they laid hands on her; and she went by way of the horses entrance into the kings house, and there she was put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jehoiada made a covenant between Jehovah, the king, and the people, to be the people of Jehovah; and also between the king and the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and tore it down. They thoroughly broke in pieces its altars and images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he took the commanders of hundreds, the mercenaries, the runners, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of Jehovah, and went by way of the gate of the runners to the kings house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was at peace, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword in the kings house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
