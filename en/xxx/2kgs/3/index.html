Will you go with me to fight against Moab? And he said, I will go up; I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, By way of the wilderness of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they made a circuit of a seven daysÂ’ journey; and there was no water for the camp, nor for the cattle at their feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king of Israel said, Alas! For Jehovah has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not a prophet of Jehovah here, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehoshaphat said, The Word of Jehovah is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother. But the king of Israel said to him, No, for Jehovah has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Elisha said, As Jehovah of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not pay attention to you, nor look at you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But now bring me a minstrel. And it happened, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, Thus says Jehovah: Make this valley full of ditches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus says Jehovah: You shall not see wind, nor shall you see rain; yet the valley shall be filled with water, so that you, your cattle, and your animals may drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this is but a slight thing in the eyes of Jehovah; He has also delivered the Moabites into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also you shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up every spring of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it happened in the morning, when the grain offering was offered, that behold, water came by way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to bear arms and older were gathered; and they took their stand at the border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun was shining on the water; and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they said, This is blood; the kings have laid waste to make desolate, and have struck down one another; now therefore, Moab, to the spoils!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So when they came to the camp of Israel, Israel rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they entered, striking to kill the Moabites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they tore down the cities, and each man threw a stone on every good piece of land and filled it; and they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees. But they left the stones of Kir Haraseth. However the slingers surrounded and struck it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle had prevailed against him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he took his firstborn son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel; so they departed from him and returned to their own land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
