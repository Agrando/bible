Then he turned and rebelled against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Jehovah sent against him raiding bands of Chaldeans, bands of Syrians, bands of Moabites, and bands of the sons of Ammon; He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken by the hand of His servants the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Surely at the mouth of Jehovah this came upon Judah, to remove them from before His face because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and also because of the innocent blood that he had shed; for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, which Jehovah was not willing to forgive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Jehoiakim rested with his fathers. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king of Egypt did not come out of his land anymore, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Brook of Egypt to the River Euphrates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mothers name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, as his servants were besieging it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his servants, his princes, and his officials went out to the king of Babylon; and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the kings house, and he cut in pieces all the articles of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah, as Jehovah had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He also carried into captivity all Jerusalem: all the commanders and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths. No one remained except the poorest people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he carried Jehoiachin captive to Babylon. The kings mother, the kings wives, his officials, and the mighty ones of prominence of the land he carried into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>All the men of valor, seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths, one thousand, all who were strong and fit for war, these the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, his uncle, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He also did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For through the anger of Jehovah it happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until He had cast them out from before His face, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
