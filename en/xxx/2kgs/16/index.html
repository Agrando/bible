He also made his son pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah had cast out before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to make war; and they besieged Ahaz but could not overcome him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>At that time Rezin king of Syria restored Elath to Syria, and cleared out the men of Judah from Elath. Then the Syrians went to Elath, and dwell there to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are rising up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasuries of the kings house, and sent it as a present to the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So the king of Assyria heeded him; for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and took it, carried its people captive to Kir, and killed Rezin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the design of the altar and its pattern, according to all its workmanship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. And Urijah the priest had it made before King Ahaz returned from Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the king came back from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king approached the altar and went up to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So he sacrificed his burnt offering with smoke and his grain offering; and he poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He also brought the bronze altar from before Jehovah, from the front of the house, from between his altar and the house of Jehovah; and put it on the north side of his altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, On the great new altar burn the morning burnt offering with smoke, the evening grain offering, the kings burnt offering, and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their grain offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice. But the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that King Ahaz had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And King Ahaz cut off the rims of the carts, and removed the lavers from them; and he took down the sea from the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the covered Sabbath structure which they had built in the house, he removed from the house of Jehovah, along with the kings outer entrance, before the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
