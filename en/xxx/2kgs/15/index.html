His mothers name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>except that the high places were not removed; the people were still sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehovah struck the king, so that he was a leper until the day of his death; so he dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the kings son was over the house, judging the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Azariah rested with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. And Jotham his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria six months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, as his fathers had done; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck and killed him in front of the people, and reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This was the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken to Jehu, saying, Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation. And so it was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Shallum the son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a month of days in Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, came to Samaria, and struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria and killed him; and reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and the treason he had conspired, behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Menahem struck Tiphsah, all who were there, and its territory from Tirzah; because they did not open to him, therefore he struck it. All the pregnant women he ripped open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi became king over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah; he did not depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Pul king of Assyria came against the land; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to strengthen the kingdom under his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Menahem brought out the money from Israel, from all the mighty men of wealth, from each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and did not stay there in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Menahem rested with his fathers. And Pekahiah his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah the son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Pekah the son of Remaliah, an officer of his, conspired against him and struck him in Samaria, in the palace of the kings house, along with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of Gilead. He killed him and reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came and took Ijon, Abel Beth Maachah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Hoshea the son of Elah conspired treason against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and struck and killed him; and he reigned in his place in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, began to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>However the high places were not removed; the people were still sacrificing and burning incense on the high places. He built the Upper Gate of the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In those days Jehovah began to send Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Jotham rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. And Ahaz his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
