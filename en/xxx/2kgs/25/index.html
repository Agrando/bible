And the king went the way toward the plain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they pronounced judgment upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, put out the eyes of Zedekiah, bound him with bronze fetters, and brought him to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And in the fifth month, on the seventh of the month (which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He burned the house of Jehovah and the kings house; all the houses of Jerusalem, that is, all the houses of distinction, he burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls of Jerusalem all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the rest of the people who remained in the city and the defectors who had fallen out to the king of Babylon, with the rest of the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The bronze pillars that were in the house of Jehovah, and the carts and the bronze sea that were in the house of Jehovah, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried the bronze to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the bronze utensils which were used in service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The firepans and the basins, the things of gold in gold and of silver in silver, the captain of the guard carried away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The two pillars, one Sea, and the carts, which Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah, the bronze of all these articles was without weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital on it was of bronze. The height of the capital was three cubits, and the network and pomegranates all around the capital were all of bronze. The second pillar was the same, with a network.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He also took out of the city an official who had charge of the men of war, five men who were found in the city who looked after the kings presence, the chief marshal of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive from its land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when all the commanders of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Careah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gedaliah swore before them and their men, and said to them, Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans.
