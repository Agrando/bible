His mothers name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in all the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And it came to pass, in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the scribe, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the house of Jehovah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money which has been brought into the house of Jehovah, which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And let them deliver it into the hand of those doing the work, who are the overseers in the house of Jehovah; let them give it to those who are in the house of Jehovah doing the work, to repair the breaches of the house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>to the craftsmen and builders and masons; and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>However there was no accounting made with them of the money delivered into their hand, because they were dealing faithfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the Book of the Law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought back word to the king, saying, Your servants have gathered the money found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of those who are doing the work, who oversee the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Shaphan the scribe reported to the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened, when the king heard the Words of the Book of the Law, that he tore his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Michaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the kings servant, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go, inquire of Jehovah for me, for the people and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that has been kindled against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. (She dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter.) And they spoke with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Tell the man who has sent you to Me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am bringing evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants; all the Words of the Book which the king of Judah has read;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath has been kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But as for the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus you shall say to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Concerning the words which you have heard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before Jehovah when you heard what I have spoken against this place and against its inhabitants, that they would become a desolation and a curse, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I also have heard you, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold therefore, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the evil that I am bringing upon this place. So they brought back word to the king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
