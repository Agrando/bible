And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him and said to him, Thus says Jehovah: Set your house in order, for you are dying, and shall not live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to Jehovah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Remember now, O Jehovah, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done what was good in Your eyes. And Hezekiah wailed with great weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it happened, before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court, that the Word of Jehovah came to him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Return and say to Hezekiah the ruler of My people, Thus says Jehovah the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will add to your days fifteen years. I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake, and for the sake of My servant David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. So they took and laid it on the boil, and he lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What is the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah the third day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Isaiah said, This is the sign to you from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the thing which He has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps or go backward ten steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Hezekiah answered, It is an easy thing for the shadow to go down ten steps; no, but let the shadow go backward ten steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Isaiah the prophet cried out to Jehovah, and He brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the sundial of Ahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At that time Berodach-Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Hezekiah was attentive to them, and showed them all the house of his treasures; the silver and gold, the spices and precious ointment, and all the house of his weapons; all that was found among his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say, and from where did they come to you? So Hezekiah said, They came from a distant land, from Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, What have they seen in your house? So Hezekiah answered, They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the Word of Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and what your fathers have laid in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they shall take away some of your sons who shall come forth from you, whom you shall beget; and they shall be officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The Word of Jehovah which you have spoken is good! For he thought, Will there not be peace and truth in my days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah; all his might, and how he made a pool and a tunnel and brought water into the city; are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Hezekiah rested with his fathers. And Manasseh his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
