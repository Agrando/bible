To His Friends: Eat, O friends! Drink, yes, get drunk, O beloved ones!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Shulamite: I sleep, but my heart is awake; it is the sound of my beloved! He knocks, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one; for my head is covered with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have stripped off my gown; how shall I put it on again? I have washed my feet; how shall I dirty them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My beloved put his hand by the latch of the door, and my heart yearned for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the lock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned away and was gone. My soul went forth when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The watchmen who went about the city found me. They struck me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took my veil away from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem: If you find my beloved, that you tell him I am lovesick!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Daughters of Jerusalem: What is your beloved more than any other beloved, O most beautiful among women? What is your beloved more than any other beloved, that you charge us so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Shulamite: My beloved is dazzling and ruddy, standing out among ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His head is like the finest gold; his locks are wavy, and black as a raven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes are like doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and set in a frame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>His cheeks are like a bed of spices, like grown herbs. His lips are like lilies, dripping flowing myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His hands are like folds of gold filled with precious stones. His torso is smooth as ivory overlaid with sapphires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>His legs are like pillars of marble set on bases of fine gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His mouth is most sweet. Yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
