According to the abundance of his fruit he has increased the altars. They have made beautiful images according to the goodness of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Their heart is divided. Now they shall be found guilty. He will break down their altars; He will destroy their images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For now they shall say, We have no king, because we did not fear Jehovah. What then should a king do for us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They have spoken words, swearing vanity in making a covenant. Thus judgment springs up like hemlock in the furrows of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The inhabitants of Samaria shall dread because of the calves of Beth-aven. For its people shall mourn over it; also its priests shall tremble over it, over its glory, because it has departed from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>It shall also be carried to Assyria, as a present to King Jareb. Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Samaria is cut off; her king is like a twig on the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also, the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. The thorn and the thistle shall grow up over their altars. And they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah. There they stood. The battle against the sons of iniquity did not overtake them in Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When it is My desire, I shall chasten them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they bind themselves to their two transgressions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Ephraim is a trained heifer, loving to tread grain. But I passed over her fair neck; I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow; Jacob shall break clods for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in kindness. Break up your fallow ground. For it is time to seek Jehovah, until He comes and rains righteousness on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You have plowed wickedness; you have reaped iniquity. You have eaten the fruit of lies because you trusted in your own way, in the multitude of your mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore an uproar shall rise up among your people. And all your fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle. The mother was dashed in pieces upon her sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus it shall be done to you, O Bethel, because of your great wickedness. At dawn, the king of Israel shall be completely cut off.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
