They sacrificed to the Baals, and burned incense to graven images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I also taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by their arms. But they did not know that I healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love. And I was to them as those who lift off the yoke from their jaws; and I held out food to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He shall not return to the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to come back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the sword shall whirl about in his cities, and shall bring to an end his isolated districts, and shall consume them, because of their own counsels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And My people are bent on backsliding from Me. Though they call to the Most High, no one at all exalts Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How shall I give you up, Ephraim? Shall I deliver you up, Israel? How shall I make you like Admah? Shall I set you as Zeboim? My heart churns within Me; My compassions are kindled together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will not execute My burning anger; I will not return to destroy Ephraim. For I am the Mighty God, and not a man, the Holy One in your midst. And I will not enter into the city with terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall walk after Jehovah; He shall roar like a lion. When He roars, then His sons shall tremble from the west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They shall tremble as a bird from Egypt, and as a dove from the land of Assyria. And I will make them live in their houses, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Ephraim circles around Me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah still walks with God and is faithful with the saints.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
