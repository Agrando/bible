And blood touches against blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>On account of this the land shall mourn, and every one living there shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yes, even the fish of the sea shall be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet let no man strive with nor reprove another man. For your people are like those who strive with a priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore you shall stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with you at night, and I will destroy your mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being priest to Me. Since you have forgotten the Law of your God, I also will forget your sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As they were increased, so they sinned against Me. I will change their glory into shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They eat up the sin of My people, and they set their appetites on their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall be: Like people, like priest. And I will visit their ways upon them and repay them for their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they shall eat and not have enough. They shall commit fornication and not bring forth, because they have ceased to take heed to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Harlotry and wine and new wine snatch away the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My people seek advice from their wooden idols, and their magic wand expounds to them. For the spirit of harlotry has led them astray, and they have committed adultery against their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinth, because their shade is good. On account of this, your daughters shall prostitute themselves, and your brides shall commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will not punish your daughters when they prostitute themselves, nor your brides when they commit adultery. For the men themselves go aside with harlots, and they sacrifice with temple prostitutes. Therefore the people who do not understand will be thrust down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Israel, though you commit fornication, do not let Judah become guilty. And do not come to Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Jehovah lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Israel rebels like a stubborn heifer. Now Jehovah will feed them as a lamb in a large area.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Ephraim is joined to idols. Let him alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Their drink is rebellion. They are continually committing fornication. Her defenders dearly love disgrace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The wind binds her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
