He comes like an eagle against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed My covenant and have rebelled against My Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Israel shall cry to Me, My God, we know You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Israel has cast off the good; the enemy shall pursue him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They have set up kings, but not by Me. They have made rulers, but I did not acknowledge it. They made idols for themselves with their silver and their gold, so that they may be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O Samaria, your calf has cast you off. My anger is kindled against them. How long until they attain to innocence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For it was also from Israel: The craftsman made it, but it is not God. But the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For they sow the wind, and they reap the whirlwind. It has no stalk; the bud shall yield no flour. If it should happen to produce, strangers will swallow it up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Israel is swallowed up. They are now among the nations as a vessel in which is no pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself. Ephraim has hired lovers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now I will gather them; and they shall begin to be few, because of the burden of the king of rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because Ephraim has made many altars to sin, they are altars to him to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have written the great things of My Law for him, but they were counted as a strange thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of My offerings, and they eat; but Jehovah does not accept them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins. They shall return to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and builds temples. And Judah has multiplied fortified cities. But I will send a fire on his cities, and it shall burn up his palaces.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
