But when he trespassed through Baal, he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And now they sin more and more, and they have made themselves molten images of their silver, idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen. They say of them, Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passes away, as chaff driven from the threshing floor by the storm, and as smoke out of the chimney.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet I am Jehovah your God, ever since the land of Egypt; and you shall know no other gods but Me. For there is no Savior besides Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have known you in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When they had pasture, they were filled. They were filled, and their heart was exalted. Therefore they have forgotten Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now I am like a lion to them; I will watch by the way like a leopard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I will meet them like a bereaved bear, and I will tear open the carcass to their heart; and like a lion, I will devour them there; the beasts of the field shall tear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O Israel, you are destroyed, but your help is in Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Where is your king now, that he may save you in all your cities? And where are your judges to whom you said, Give to me a king and rulers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I gave you a king in My anger, and took him away in My fury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is treasured up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The pangs of a woman giving birth shall come upon him; he is an unwise son, for he does not stay long where children are born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will ransom them from the hand of Sheol; I will redeem them from death. O death, where are your plagues? O Sheol, where is your destruction? Sorrow is hidden from My eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Though he is fruitful among brothers, an east wind shall come. The wind of Jehovah shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall be disappointed because his fountain shall be dried up. He shall plunder the treasure of all desirable vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Samaria is held guilty, for she has rebelled against her God. They shall fall by the sword, their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped open.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
