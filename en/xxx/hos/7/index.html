For they have dealt falsely; and a thief comes; a troop of robbers plunders outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they do not consider within their hearts that I remember all their evil. Now their own doings have surrounded them. They are before My face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They make the king glad with their evil, and the rulers with their lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They are all adulterers, like an oven heated by the baker; he ceases from stirring after kneading the dough until it is leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In the day of our king, the rulers have made themselves sick, inflamed with wine. He stretches out his hand with scorners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For they have prepared their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait. Their baker sleeps all night; in the morning it burns like a flaming fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges. All their kings have fallen; not one among them calls unto Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ephraim has mixed himself among the peoples. Ephraim is a cake not turned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Strangers have eaten up his strength, yet he does not know it. Yea, gray hairs are sprinkled here and there on him, yet he does not know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. And they do not return to Jehovah their God, nor seek Him for all this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart; they call to Egypt; they go to Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they go, I will spread My net upon them; I will bring them down like the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, according to the report their congregation heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Woe to them! For they have fled from Me. Ruin to them! For they have transgressed against Me. Though I redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they have not cried to Me with their heart, when they wailed on their beds. They assemble themselves for grain and wine; they turn aside from Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Though I disciplined, I made their arms strong; yet they devise evil against Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They return, but not to the Most High. They are like a treacherous bow. Their rulers shall fall by the sword from the rage of their tongue. This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
