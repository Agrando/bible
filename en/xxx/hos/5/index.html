And give ear, O house of the king. For judgment is toward you, because you have been a snare to Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And revolters are deep in slaughter, though I chasten all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me. For now, O Ephraim, you have committed harlotry; Israel is defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They do not devote their doings to turn back to their God. For the spirit of harlotry is in their midst, and they do not know Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. Therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity. Judah shall also stumble with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah, but they shall not find Him; He has withdrawn Himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah, for they have brought forth strange sons. Now a new moon shall devour them with their heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Blow the shofar in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah. Cry aloud at Beth-aven; after you, O Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Israel I have made known that which is sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The rulers of Judah were like those who move borders; I will pour out My wrath on them like water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ephraim is oppressed and crushed in judgment, because he has willingly walked, keeping back from the commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, I will be to Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to King Jareb. Yet he could not heal you, nor did he cure you of your wound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For I am to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah; I, even I, tear and go away; I take away, and no one rescues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will go and return to My place until they confess their guilt and seek My face. In their affliction they will seek Me earnestly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
