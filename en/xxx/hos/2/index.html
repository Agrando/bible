Contend with your mother, for she is not My wife, nor am I her husband. Therefore, let her put away her harlotries from her presence, and her adulteries from between her breasts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>lest I strip her naked and set her out as in the day that she was born, and make her as the wilderness, and make her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will not have compassion on her sons, for they are the sons of harlotries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For their mother has prostituted herself; she who conceived them has behaved shamefully. For she said, I will go after my lovers who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and I will close off her wall, so that she shall not find her paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not reach to them. And she shall seek them, but shall not find them. Then she shall say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then it was better with me than now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For she did not know that I gave her grain and wine and oil, and I multiplied her silver and the gold which they prepared for Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I will return and take away My grain in its time, and My wine in its season. And I will take back My wool and My linen given to cover her nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now I will uncover her lewdness in the eyes of her lovers, and no man shall deliver her out of My hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I will also put an end to all her joy, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, of which she has said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me. And I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will visit upon her the days of the Baals in which she burned incense to them. She even adorned herself with her nose rings, and her jewels, and she went after her lovers and forgot Me, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, behold, I will seduce her and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And from there I will give her vineyards to her, and the Valley of Achor for a door of hope. And she shall respond there as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And in that day, says Jehovah, you shall call Me, My Husband; and you shall no more call Me, My Master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth; and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground. And I will break the bow and the sword, and the battle out of the earth, and I will make them lie down safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will betroth you to Me forever. Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness, and in justice, and in kindness, and in compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I will even betroth you to Me in faithfulness. And you shall know Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall come to pass in that day that I will answer, says Jehovah. I will answer the heavens, and they shall respond to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the earth shall respond with grain, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will sow her unto Me in the earth. And I will have mercy on No Mercy. And I will say to those who were Not My People, You are My people! And they shall say, You are My God!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
