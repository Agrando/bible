And they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jehovah also has a quarrel with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; He will repay him according to his deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he contended with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yes, he wept and pleaded with Him, and he contended with the Angel and prevailed. He found Him at Bethel, and He spoke with us there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>even Jehovah the God of Hosts. Jehovah is His memorial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore return to your God; keep kindness and justice, and wait for your God continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He is a merchant; the scales of deceit are in his hand; he loves to oppress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Ephraim said, I am rich; I have found much wealth for myself. In all my labors they shall find no iniquity in me that is sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But I am Jehovah your God ever since the land of Egypt; I will again make you live in tents, as in the days of the appointed feasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and used parables by the hand of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Is Gilead evil? Surely they are vanity. They sacrificed bulls in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jacob fled into the land of Syria, and Israel served for a wife; yea, he kept sheep for a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was protected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ephraim has provoked Him to anger most bitterly. Therefore He shall leave the guilt of his blood upon him, and his Lord shall return his reproach unto him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
