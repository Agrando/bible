The man spoke to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Surely I am more stupid than any man, and do not have the understanding of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have not learned wisdom, nor the knowledge of the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who has gone up into Heaven, or descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name, and what is His Sons name? Surely you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not add to His Words, that He not judge you and you be found a liar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Two things I have asked of You (Do not withhold them before I die):</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Remove far from me vanity and lying words; give me neither poverty or riches, provide for me my prescribed portion of food;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>lest I be full and deny You and say, Who is Jehovah? Or lest I be poor and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not accuse a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be found guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is a generation that curses their father, and does not bless their mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes, and yet is not washed from its excrement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! And their eyelids are lifted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There is a generation whose teeth are like swords, and their jaw teeth like knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The leech has two daughters, crying, Give, give! Three things are never satisfied, yea, four things never say, Enough!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Sheol, and the barren womb, the earth that is not satisfied with water, and the fire; these have not said, Enough!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The eye that mocks his father and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Three things are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I do not know:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship in the middle of the sea, and the way of a man with a virgin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, I have done no wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Under three things the earth quakes, and under four it is not able to bear up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For a servant when he reigns, a fool when he is filled with food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>a hateful woman when she is married, and a maidservant that is heir to her mistress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Four things are little on the earth, but they are exceedingly wise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>the hyrax are not a mighty people, yet they make their dwellings in the crags;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the locusts have no king, yet all of them go forth in swarms;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>you can catch a lizard with the hands, yet it is in kings palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There are three things that are beautiful in their stride, yea, four that go right along:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The lion is mighty among beasts and does not turn back from the face of anything;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>one girded in the loins; and a he goat; and a king with his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If you have done foolishly in exalting yourself, or if you have devised evil, lay your hand over your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Surely the churning of milk yields butter, and the squeezing of the nose brings forth blood; so the wringing of wrath brings forth strife.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
