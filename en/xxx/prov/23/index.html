For riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away like an eagle into the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not eat the bread of him who has an evil eye, nor desire his dainty foods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for as he thinks in his heart, so is he. Eat and drink! he says to you, but his heart is not with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The morsel you have eaten, you shall vomit up, and spoil your pleasant words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not remove the ancient landmarks, and do not enter into the fields of the fatherless;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for their Redeemer is mighty; He shall plead their case against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to the words of knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not withhold correction from a lad, for if you beat him with the rod, he will not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall beat him with the rod, and shall deliver his soul from Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My son, if your heart is wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yea, my heart shall rejoice when your lips speak right things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do not let your heart envy sinners; but be in the fear of Jehovah all the day long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For surely there is a hereafter, and your hope shall not be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hear, my son, and be wise, and guide your heart in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not be among those who are heavy drinkers of wine, or among gluttons for flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty, and slumber shall clothe a man with rags.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Listen to your father who begot you, and do not despise your mother when she is old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice; and he who begets a wise child shall be glad because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Your father and your mother shall be glad, and she who bore you shall rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>My son, give Me your heart, and let your eyes take pleasure in observing My ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For a harlot is a deep pit, and a foreign woman is a narrow well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>She also lies in wait as for prey, and increases treachery among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who has woe?
