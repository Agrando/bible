Solomon also made a house like this porch for PharaohÂ’s daughter, whom he had taken as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>All these were of costly stones cut to size, sawn with saws, inside and out, from the foundation to the coping, and also on the outside to the great court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The foundation was of costly stones, large stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And above were costly stones, hewn to size, and cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The great court was of three rows of hewn stones and a row of cedar beams. So were the inner court of the house of Jehovah and the porch of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He was the son of a widow woman from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, engraving in bronze; he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill to work in all workmanship in bronze. So he came to King Solomon and did all his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he cast two pillars of bronze, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a line of twelve cubits circled all the way around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he made two capitals of cast bronze, to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He made a lattice network, with braids of chainwork, for the capitals on top of the pillars: seven for one capital and seven for the other capital.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he made the pillars, and two rows of pomegranates above the network all around to cover the capitals on top; and thus he did for the other capital.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The capitals which were on top of the pillars in the hall were made like lilies, four cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The capitals on the two pillars also had pomegranates above, by the belly which was next to the network; and there were two hundred such pomegranates in rows on the other capital all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he set up the pillars by the porch of the temple; he set up the pillar on the right and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the left and called its name Boaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The tops of the pillars were made like lilies. Thus the work of the pillars was finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he made the cast sea of ten cubits from brim to brim; it was round all around. Its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits made a circuit all the way around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Below its brim round about were gourds all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the sea. The gourds were cast in two rows when it was cast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It stood on twelve oxen: three turned toward the north, three turned toward the west, three turned toward the south, and three turned toward the east; the sea was set on top of them, and all their back parts were inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Its thickness was a handbreadth; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom; and it could hold two thousand baths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he made ten carts of bronze; four cubits the length of the one cart, and four cubits the breadth, and three cubits the height.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And this was the work of the cart: they had borders, and there were borders between the stays.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And on the borders that were between the stays were lions, oxen, and cherubim. And a pedestal was on the stays above. And below the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And each cart had four wheels of bronze, and axles of bronze. And its four feet were supports to them; under the basin were cast supports with wreaths at each side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And its opening within and above the capital was a cubit; and its opening was round like the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half. And also on its opening were carvings; and their borders were square, not round.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the four wheels were under the borders. And the axles of the wheels were attached to the cart; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And there were four supports at the four corners of each cart; its supports were part of the cart itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>On the top of the cart was a round compass a half cubit in height. And on the top of the cart, its stays and its supports were of the same casting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>On the plates of its stays and on its borders he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, wherever there was a clear space on each, with wreaths all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus he made the ten carts. All of them were of the same cast, one measure, and one shape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he made ten basins of bronze; each basin could hold forty baths, and each basin was four cubits. On each of the ten carts was a basin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he put five carts on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward toward the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Hiram made the basins, the shovels and the bowls. Thus Hiram finished doing all the work that he did for King Solomon for the house of Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two networks covering the two bowls of the capitals which were on top of the pillars;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on top of the pillars);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>the ten carts, and ten basins on the carts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>the one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>the pots, the shovels, and the bowls. All these articles which Hiram made for King Solomon for the house of Jehovah were of burnished bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in the clay ground between Succoth and Zaretan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Solomon did not weigh all the articles, because there were so very many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Thus Solomon had all the articles made for the house of Jehovah: the altar of gold, and the table of gold on which was the Bread of the Presence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right side and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary, with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>the basins, the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house (the Holy of Holies) and for the doors of the house of the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Thus all the work that King Solomon had done for the house of Jehovah was finished; and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had consecrated: the silver and the gold and the articles, and He put them in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
