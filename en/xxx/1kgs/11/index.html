Truly they will thrust aside your hearts after their gods. These, Solomon clung to in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives thrust away his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For so it was, when Solomon was old, that his wives thrust his heart aside after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as was the heart of his father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For Solomon departed after Ashtaroth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Solomon did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and did not fully follow after Jehovah, like his father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he did likewise for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned aside from Jehovah the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and had charged him concerning this thing, that he should not depart after other gods; but he had not kept what Jehovah had charged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore Jehovah said to Solomon, Because you have done this, and have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have charged you, I will rend to tear the kingdom away from you, and have given it to your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Nevertheless I will not do it in your days, for the sake of your father David; I shall tear it out of the hand of your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However I will not tear away the whole kingdom; I shall give one tribe to your son for the sake of my servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the seed of the king in Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, after he had killed every male in Edom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(because for six months Joab remained there with all Israel, until he had cut down every male in Edom),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that Hadad fled to go to Egypt, he and certain Edomites of his fathers servants with him. Hadad was still a little child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they rose up out of Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, apportioned food for him, and gave him land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Hadad found great favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, that is, the sister of Queen Tahpenes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaohs house. And Genubath was in Pharaohs household among the sons of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So when Hadad heard in Egypt that David had rested with his fathers, and that Joab the commander of the army had died, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me, that behold you are seeking to go to your own land? And he answered, Nothing, however send me away to let me go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And God raised up another adversary against him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer king of Zobah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So he gathered men to him and became leader over a band of raiders, when David killed those of Zobah. And they went to Damascus and dwelt there, and reigned in Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon (besides the evil that Hadad did); and he loathed Israel, and reigned over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Solomons servant, an Ephrathite from Zereda, whose mothers name was Zeruah, a widow woman, also lifted up his hand against the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this was the matter for which he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon had built the Millo and repaired the breaches to the City of David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, and made him overseer over the burden bearers of the house of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it happened at that time, when Jeroboam had gone out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the way; and he was clothed with a new garment, and the two were alone in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Ahijah took hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to Jeroboam, Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Behold, I am tearing the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and have given ten tribes to you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>(but he shall have one tribe for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>because they have forsaken Me, and bowed down to Ashtaroth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways to do what is right in My eyes and to keep My statutes and My judgments, as did his father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of My servant David, whom I have chosen because he has kept My commandments and My statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But I have taken the kingdom out of his sons hand and given it to you; ten tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for Myself, to put My name there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I will take you, and you shall reign according to all your souls desires, and you shall be king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it shall be, if you heed all that I command you, walk in My ways, and do what is right in My eyes, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as My servant David has done, then I will be with you and build for you an enduring house, as I have built for David, and will give Israel to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will afflict the seed of David because of this, but not for all time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the Acts of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the days that Solomon had reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Solomon rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
