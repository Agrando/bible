Then Jeroboam and the whole assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Your father had made our yoke severe; now therefore, lighten the hard service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he had put on us, and we will serve you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he said to them, Go away for three days, then come back to me. And the people departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, and he said, How do you counsel me to answer these people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they spoke to him, saying, If you will be a servant to these people today, and serve them, and answer them, and speak agreeable words to them, then they will be your servants all your days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he rejected the counsel which the elders had given him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who were standing before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to them, What counsel do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, Lighten the yoke which your father has put on us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus you shall speak to this people who have spoken to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us; thus you shall say to them: My little finger has become fatter than my fatherÂ’s loins!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Come back to me the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king answered the people harshly, and rejected the counsel which the elders had given him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus the king did not give heed to the people; for the turn of events was from Jehovah, to establish His word, which Jehovah had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when all Israel saw that the king had not heeded them, the people answered the king, saying: What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Now, see to your own house, O David! And Israel departed to their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute, but all Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. Therefore King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back, that they sent for him and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel. There was no one who followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah with the tribe of Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand choice men who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, that he might restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the Word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus says Jehovah: You shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel. Let every man return to his house, for this thing has come about from Me. Therefore they obeyed the Word of Jehovah, and returned to go back, according to the Word of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jeroboam built Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim, and dwelt there. Also he went out from there and built Penuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jeroboam thought in his heart, Now the kingdom may return to the house of David:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn back to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me and go back to Rehoboam king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore the king took counsel, made two calves of gold, and said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Behold your gods, O Israel, which brought you up from the land of Egypt!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he set up one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now this thing became a sin, for the people went before the one, even as far as Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He made houses on the high places, and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jeroboam instituted a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the feast that was in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. Thus he did at Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. And at Bethel he installed the priests of the high places which he had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus he offered up on the altar which he had made at Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month which he had contrived in his own heart. And he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and offered sacrifices on the altar and burned incense.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
