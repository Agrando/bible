He was also very good in appearance. And his mother had borne him after Absalom.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he spoke with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they went after Adonijah and helped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David were not with Adonijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En Rogel; he also invited all his brothers, the kings sons, and all the men of Judah, the kings servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or Solomon his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Come now, please let me counsel you with advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Depart and go to King David and say to him, Have you not sworn to your maidservant, my lord, O king, saying, Surely your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then has Adonijah become king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then, while you are still speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Bathsheba came into the chamber to the king. (Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Bathsheba bowed and did homage to the king. And the king said, What can I do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she said to him, My lord, you have sworn by Jehovah your God to your maidservant, saying, Surely Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So now, behold, Adonijah has become king; and now, my lord the king, you have not known about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army; but Solomon your servant he has not invited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as for you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king lies down with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted as offenders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they reported to the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he came in before the king, he bowed down to the king with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he has gone down today, and has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the kings sons, and the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and behold, they are eating and drinking before him; and they said, Long live King Adonijah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But he has not invited me; me your servant, nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king, and you have not declared to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then King David answered and said, Summon Bathsheba to me. So she came before the king and stood before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king swore and said, As Jehovah lives, who has redeemed my life from every distress,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>just as I have sworn to you by Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place, thus I shall do this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did homage to the king, and said, Let my lord King David live forever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And King David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came in before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel; and blow the shofar, and say, Long live King Solomon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when you have come up after him, he shall come and sit on my throne, and he shall be king in my place. For I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, Amen! Thus says Jehovah the God of my lord the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>As Jehovah has been with my lord the king, even so shall He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King Davids mule, and brought him to Gihon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. And they blew the shofar, and all the people said, Long live King Solomon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And all the people went up after him; and the people played the flutes and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth was rent with their sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had finished eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the shofar, he said, Why is the city in such a commotion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And while he was still speaking, behold Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest came in. And Adonijah said to him, Come in, for you are a mighty man, and bring good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, No rather, our lord King David has made Solomon king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the kings mule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is all stirred up. This is the sound that you have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Also Solomon has sat down on the throne of the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And moreover the kings servants have gone to bless our lord King David, saying, May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Also the king has said, Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, with my eyes seeing it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So all the guests who were with Adonijah trembled, and rose up, and each one went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Adonijah was afraid of Solomon; so he arose, and went and took hold of the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it was reported to Solomon, saying, Behold Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon; for behold, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon swear to me this day that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Solomon said, If he is a son of worth, not one hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if evil is found in him, he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
