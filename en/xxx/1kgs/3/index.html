For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the word was good in the eyes of Jehovah, that Solomon had asked this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God said to him: Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked long life for yourself, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>behold, I have done according to your words; behold, I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has not been anyone like you before you, nor shall any like you arise after you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I have also given you what you have not asked: both riches and honor, so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So if you walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as your father David has walked, then I will prolong your days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Solomon awoke; and behold it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, offered up burnt offerings, offered peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now two women who were harlots came to the king, and stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And one woman said, O my lord, this woman and I are dwelling in the same house; and I gave birth while she was in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then it happened on the third day after I gave birth, that this woman also gave birth. And we were together; no one was with us in the house, except the two of us in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this womans son died in the night, because she had lain on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from my side, while your maidservant slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when I arose in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead. But when I had examined him in the morning, behold, he was not my son whom I had borne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the other woman said, No! But the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son. And the first woman said, No! But the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the king said, The one says, This is my son, who lives, and your son is the dead one; and the other says, No! But your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king said, Bring me a sword. So they brought a sword before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to one, and half to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the woman whose son was living spoke to the king, for her womb yearned for her son; and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and do not put him to death! But the other said, Let him be neither mine nor yours, but divide him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and do not put him to death; she is his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had rendered, and they feared his presence; for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to execute justice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
