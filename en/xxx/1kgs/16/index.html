And Elah his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And also the Word of Jehovah came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, because of all the evil that he had done in the eyes of Jehovah to provoke Him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel, and reigned two years in Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him as he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, steward of his house in Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Zimri went in and struck him and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he was seated on his throne, that he killed all the household of Baasha; he did not leave him one who urinates against a wall, neither of his kinsmen nor of his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha, according to the Word of Jehovah, which He had spoken against Baasha by the hand of Jehu the prophet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, by which they had sinned and by which they had made Israel sin, in provoking Jehovah the God of Israel to anger with their vanities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri had reigned in Tirzah seven days. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people who were encamped heard it said, Zimri has conspired and also has killed the king. So all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon, and they besieged Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it happened, when Zimri saw that the city had been taken, that he went into the citadel of the kings house and burned the kings house down upon himself with fire, and died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because of the sins which he had sinned in doing evil in the eyes of Jehovah, in walking in the ways of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he had done to make Israel sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the treason he committed, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed after Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half after Omri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the people following after Omri prevailed over the people following after Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri reigned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel, and reigned twelve years. Six years he reigned in Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, Samaria, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Omri did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and did worse than all who were before him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for he walked in all the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin, to provoke Jehovah the God of Israel to anger with their vanities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. And Ahab his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel; and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, more than all who were before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians; and he went and served Baal and bowed down to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he set up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Ahab made a grove. Ahab did more to provoke Jehovah the God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho. He laid its foundation with Abiram his firstborn, and with his youngest son Segub he set up its gates, according to the Word of Jehovah, which He had spoken through Joshua the son of Nun.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
