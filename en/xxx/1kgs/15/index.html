His mothers name was Maachah the daughter of Abishalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; his heart was not perfect toward Jehovah his God, as was the heart of his father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nevertheless for Davids sake Jehovah his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him to establish Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>because David had done what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and had not turned aside from anything that He had commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah. And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abijam rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa became king over Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Maachah the daughter of Abishalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Asa did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, as did his father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he took away the male temple prostitutes from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Also he removed Maachah his mother from being queen mother, because she had made a horrible thing in a grove. And Asa cut down her horrible thing and burned it by the Brook Kidron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the high places were not removed. Nevertheless Asas heart was perfect toward Jehovah all his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He also brought into the house of Jehovah the things which his father had set apart, and the things which he himself had set apart: silver and gold and utensils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might let no one go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah and the treasuries of the kings house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-Hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let there be a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you a present of silver and gold. Come and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the commanders of his forces against the cities of Israel. And he struck Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maachah, and all Chinnereth, with all the land of Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now it happened, when Baasha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah, and remained in Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then King Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; no one was exempted. And they took away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah. But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Asa rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam had become king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of his father, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him. And Baasha killed him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel was laying siege to Gibbethon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it was so, when he became king, that he killed all the house of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he had sinned and by which he had made Israel sin, because of his provocation with which he had provoked Jehovah the God of Israel to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel in Tirzah, and reigned twenty-four years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of Jeroboam, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
