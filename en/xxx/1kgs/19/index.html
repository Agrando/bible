And he requested for his soul that he might die, and said, It is enough! Now, Jehovah, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And as he lay and slept under a broom tree, behold an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he looked, and behold, by his head was a cake baked on coals, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank, and turned and lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Angel of Jehovah came back the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he arose, and ate and drank; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights as far as Horeb, the mountain of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there he came into a cave, and spent the night there; and behold, the Word of Jehovah came to him, and He said to him, What are you doing here, Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I have been very zealous for Jehovah the God of Hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek my soul, to take it away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And He said, Go out, and stand on the mountain before Jehovah. And behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before Jehovah, but Jehovah was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but Jehovah was not in the earthquake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and after the earthquake a fire, but Jehovah was not in the fire; and after the fire a whisper of a small voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And so it was, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave; and behold, a voice came to him, and said, What are you doing here, Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, I have been very zealous for Jehovah the God of Hosts; because the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek my soul, to take it away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jehovah said to him: Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when you have come there, anoint Hazael as king over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also you shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi as king over Israel. And Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It shall be that whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall kill; and whoever escapes the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall kill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet I have left in Israel seven thousand, all whose knees have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. And Elijah passed by him and threw his mantle on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah, and said, Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow after you. And he said to him, Turn and go back, for what have I done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Elisha turned back from after him, and took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them and boiled their flesh, using the oxens implements, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah, and served him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
