Thus he made chambers all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The lowest chamber was five cubits wide, the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for he made narrow ledges around the outside of the house, so that the support beams would not be fastened into the walls of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the house, when it was being built, was built with stone finished at the quarry, so that no hammer or ax or any iron tool was heard in the house while it was being built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The doorway for the middle level was on the right side of the house. They went up by a winding staircase to the middle level, and from the middle to the third.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus he built the house and finished it, and he paneled the house with beams and planks of cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he built chambers against the entire house, each five cubits high; they were attached to the house with cedar beams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Concerning this house which you are building, if you walk in My statutes, execute My judgments, keep all My commandments to walk in them, then I will establish My word with you, which I have spoken unto your father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus Solomon built the house and finished it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he built the walls of the house on the inside with cedar boards; from the walls of the house to the ceiling he paneled the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with planks of cypress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he built twenty-cubits at the rear of the house, from floor to the walls, with cedar boards; he built it inside for the inner sanctuary, the Holy of Holies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in front of the inner house the rest of the temple was forty cubits long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And on the cedar inside the house were carvings of gourds and open flowers. All was of cedar; no stone was seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he prepared the inner sanctuary inside the house, to set the ark of the covenant of Jehovah there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The faces of the inner sanctuary were twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. And he overlaid it with pure gold, and overlaid the altar with cedar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold. He stretched gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house; also he overlaid with gold the entire altar that was by the inner sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Inside the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>One wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub five cubits: ten cubits from the end of one wing to the end of the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the other cherub was ten cubits; both cherubim were of the same size and the same shape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was the other cherub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he set the cherubim inside the inner house; and they stretched out the wings of the cherubim so that the wing of the one touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall. And their wings touched each other in the middle of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he carved all the walls of the house all around, inside and out, with carved figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, both inside and out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood; the lintel and doorposts were one-fifth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The two doors were of olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he beat out the gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And for the door of the temple he also made doorposts of olive wood; one-fourth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the two doors were of cypress wood; two panels comprised one folding door, and two panels comprised the other folding door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers on them, and overlaid them with gold smoothly fitted to the carved work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In the fourth year the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid, in the month of Ziv.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its details and according to all its plans. Thus he was seven years in building it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
