Behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to provide for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold the widow woman was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, Please bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as she was going to get it, he called to her and said, Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she said, As Jehovah your God lives, I do not have a cake, only a handful of flour in a jar, and a little oil in a jug; and behold, I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Elijah said to her, Do not fear; go and do as you have said, but make me a small cake from it first, and bring it to me; and afterward make some for yourself and your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: The jar of flour shall not be used up, nor shall the jug of oil become empty, until the day that Jehovah sends rain upon the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So she went and did according to the word of Elijah; and she and he and her household ate many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The jar of flour was not used up, nor did the jug of oil become empty, according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken by the hand of Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now it happened after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became sick; and his sickness was very severe until there was no breath left in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So she said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, O man of God? Have you come to me to bring my iniquity to remembrance, and to kill my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to her, Give me your son. So he took him out of her bosom and carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he cried out unto Jehovah and said, O Jehovah my God, have You also brought tragedy upon the widow woman who is showing me hospitality, by killing her son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he stretched himself out on the child three times, and cried out unto Jehovah and said, O Jehovah my God, I pray, let this childÂ’s soul return into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehovah heeded the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came back into him, and he revived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house, and gave him to his mother. And Elijah said, See, your son lives!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that you are a man of God, and that the Word of Jehovah in your mouth is truth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
