And he called them the land of Cabul, to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hiram sent the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this is the reason for the labor force which King Solomon raised: to build the house of Jehovah, his own house, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burned it with fire, had killed the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomons wife.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Solomon built Gezer, lower Beth Horon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>all the storage cities that Solomon had, cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All the people who were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that is, their sons who were left in the land after them, whom the children of Israel had not been able to destroy completely; from these Solomon raised forced labor, as it is to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But of the children of Israel Solomon made no slaves, because they were men of war and his servants: his officers, his captains, commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Others were chiefs of the officers who were over Solomons work: five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people who did the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When Pharaohs daughter had come up from the City of David to her house which Solomon had built for her, then he built the Millo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built unto Jehovah, and he burned incense on the altar that was before Jehovah. Thus he finished the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, seamen who knew the sea, along with the servants of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they came to Ophir, and carried away four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
