And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire at the Word of Jehovah today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to fight, or shall I refrain? And they said, Go up, for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not still a prophet of Jehovah here, that we may inquire of Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, because he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the king of Israel summoned a certain official and said, Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah quickly!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, having put on their robes, sat each on his throne, at a vacant spot at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself; and he said, Thus says Jehovah: With these you shall thrust at the Syrians to destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for Jehovah will deliver it into the kings hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets with one mouth are agreeable to the king. Please, let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak pleasant things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Micaiah said, As Jehovah lives, whatever Jehovah says to me, that I will speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he came to the king; and the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall we refrain? And he answered him, Go and prosper, for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he said, I have seen all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep having no shepherd. And Jehovah said, These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Micaiah said, Therefore hear the Word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the host of Heaven standing by, on His right hand and on His left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah said, Who will persuade Ahab to go up, that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead? So one said this, and another was saying that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then a spirit came forward and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehovah said to him, In what way? And he said, I will go out and be a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets. And Jehovah said, You shall entice him, and also prevail. Go out and do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore now behold, Jehovah has put a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all these prophets of yours, and Jehovah has spoken calamity against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way did the spirit from Jehovah go from me to speak to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the kings son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and say, Thus says the king: Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction, until I come in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Micaiah said, If you return to come back in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, All you people, pay attention!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two commanders of his chariots, saying, Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And so it was, when the commanders of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel! Therefore they turned aside to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it happened, when the commanders of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the battle increased that day; and the king was propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians, and died at evening. And the blood ran out from the wound onto the floor of the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as the sun was going down, a shout went throughout the camp, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own land!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria. And they buried the king in Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And someone washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, the ivory house which he built and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Ahab rested with his fathers. And Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jehoshaphat the son of Asa had become king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he walked in all the ways of his father Asa. He did not turn aside from them, doing what was right in the eyes of Jehovah. Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, for the people offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Also Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the might that he showed, and how he made war, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the rest of the male temple prostitutes, who had remained in the days of his father Asa, he removed out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>There was then no king in Edom, only a deputy of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jehoshaphat had made merchant ships to go to Ophir for gold; but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion Geber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. And Jehoram his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of his father and in the ways of his mother and in the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>for he served Baal and bowed down to him, and provoked Jehovah the God of Israel to anger, according to all that his father had done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
