Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who told me that I would be king over this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Also take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him; he will tell you what shall become of the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jeroboams wife did so; she arose and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see, for his eyes had become fixed by reason of his age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehovah had said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to ask you something about her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus you shall say to her; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will pretend to be another woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And so it was, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in the door, that he said, Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why do you pretend to be another person? For I am sent to you with a difficult message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go, say to Jeroboam, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Because I have exalted you from among the people, and appointed you ruler over My people Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to you; and yet you have not been as My servant David, who kept My commandments and who walked after Me with all his heart, to do only what was right in My eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but you have done more evil than all who were before you, for you have gone and made for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me to anger, and have cast Me behind your back;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>therefore behold, I am bringing calamity upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him who urinates against a wall, both bond and free in Israel; I will consume the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as one takes away the dung for burning until it is all gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The dogs shall eat whoever of Jeroboam dies in the city, and the birds of the heavens shall eat whoever dies in the field; for Jehovah has spoken!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Arise therefore, go to your own house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he is the only one of Jeroboam who shall come to the grave; because out of the whole house of Jeroboam, only in him there is found something good toward Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover Jehovah shall raise up for Himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day. What? Even straightaway!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For Jehovah shall strike Israel, as a reed flutters in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land which He has given to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their groves, provoking Jehovah to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who has sinned and has made Israel sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jeroboams wife arose and departed, and came to Tirzah. And as she was entering the threshold of the house, the boy died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken by the hand of His servant Ahijah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he reigned, behold they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The days that Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years. And he rested with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king. He reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mothers name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Judah did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and they provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they sinned, more than all that their fathers had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and groves on every high hill and under every green tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And there were also male temple prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which Jehovah had cast out before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the kings house; he took away everything. He also took away all the gold shields which Solomon had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the chief runners who guarded the door to the kings house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And whenever the king went to the house of Jehovah, the runners carried them, then brought them back into the guardroom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. His mothers name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
