(Now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For so it was, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah had taken one hundred prophets and hidden them, fifty to a cave, and had fed them with bread and water.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land to all the springs of water and to all the brooks; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, so that we will not have to destroy any of the livestock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they divided the land between them, to pass through it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as Obadiah was on his way, behold Elijah met him; and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, Is that you, my lord Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he answered him, It is I. Go, tell your master, Behold, Elijah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, How have I sinned, that you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As Jehovah your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to hunt for you; and when they said, He is not here, he took an oath from the kingdom or nation that they did not find you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now you are saying, Go, tell your master, Behold Elijah is here!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of Jehovah will carry you to a place I do not know; so when I go and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he will kill me. But I your servant have feared Jehovah from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid one hundred men of the prophets of Jehovah, fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And now you say, Go, tell your master, Behold Elijah is here. He will kill me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Elijah said, As Jehovah of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely present myself to him today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and reported to him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Is that you, O troubler of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he answered, I have not troubled Israel, but you and your fathers house have, in that you have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah and have gone after the Baals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore, send and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of the groves, who eat at Jezebels table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long will you be limping between two divided opinions? If Jehovah is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow after him. But the people answered him not a word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Elijah said to the people, I alone am left a prophet of Jehovah; but Baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore let them give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other bull, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call upon the name of Jehovah; and the god who answers by fire, He is God. So all the people answered and said, The word is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon, saying, O Baal, hear us! But there was no voice; no one answered. Then they leaped about the altar which they had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And so it was, at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So they cried aloud, and cut themselves, as was their custom, with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when midday was past, they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice; no one answered, no one paid attention.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah that was broken down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the Word of Jehovah had come, saying, Israel shall be your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah; and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and said, Fill four waterpots with water, and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then he said, Do it a second time, and they did it a second time; and he said, Do it a third time, and they did it a third time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the water ran all around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it came to pass, at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your Word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Testify, O Jehovah, testify, that this people may know that You are Jehovah God, and that You have turned their hearts around back to You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then the fire of Jehovah fell and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, Jehovah, He is God! Jehovah, He is God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Elijah said to them, Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape! So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and slaughtered them there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. So he went up and looked, and said, There is nothing. And seven times he said, Go back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And it came to pass the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there is a cloud, as small as a mans hand, rising out of the sea! So he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Prepare your chariot, and go down before the rain stops you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And it happened in the meantime that the sky became black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the hand of Jehovah came upon Elijah; and he girded up his loins and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
