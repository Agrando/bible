Thus says Jehovah: Behold, a son, Josiah by name, shall be born to the house of David; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and mens bones shall be burned on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign that Jehovah has spoken this: Behold, the altar shall split apart, and the ashes on it shall be poured out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So it came to pass when King Jeroboam heard the utterance of the man of God, who cried out against the altar in Bethel, that he stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying, Arrest him! And his hand, which he had stretched forth toward him, withered, so that he could not pull it back to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the Word of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the king answered and said to the man of God, Please entreat the face of Jehovah your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me. So the man of God entreated Jehovah, and the kings hand was restored to him, and became as before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the man of God said to the king, If you were to give me half your house, I would not go in with you; nor would I eat bread nor drink water in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For so it was commanded me by the Word of Jehovah, saying, You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way you have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So he went another way and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now an old prophet dwelt in Bethel, and his sons came and recounted to him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their father said to them, Which way did he go? For his sons had seen which way the man of God had gone, who had come from Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to his sons, Saddle the donkey for me. So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. And he said to him, Are you the man of God who came from Judah? And he said, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to him, Come home with me and eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, I cannot return with you nor go in with you; neither can I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I have been told by the Word of Jehovah, You shall not eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by going the way you came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to him, I too am a prophet as you are, and an angel has spoken to me by the Word of Jehovah, saying, Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he turned back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it happened, as they sat at the table, that the Word of Jehovah came to the prophet who had brought him back;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, saying, Thus says Jehovah: Because you have disobeyed the Word of Jehovah, and have not kept the commandment with which Jehovah your God has charged you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but you turned back, ate bread, and drank water in the place of which He said to you, Eat no bread and drink no water, your corpse shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So it was, after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, the prophet whom he had brought back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he left, a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his corpse was thrown on the road, and the donkey was standing by it. The lion also was standing by the corpse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And behold, men were passing by and saw the corpse thrown on the road, and the lion standing by the corpse. And they came and spoke of it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard it, he said, It is the man of God who had been rebellious against the mouth of Jehovah. Therefore Jehovah has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle the donkey for me. So they saddled it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went and found his corpse thrown on the road, and the donkey and the lion standing by the corpse. The lion had not eaten the corpse nor torn the donkey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. So the old prophet came to the city to mourn, and to bury him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he laid the corpse in his own tomb; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So it was, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the word which he has cried out by the Word of Jehovah against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>After these events Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but he went back to making priests from among all the people for the high places; whoever wished, he confirmed his hand, and he became one of the priests of the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And this matter was the sin of the house of Jeroboam, so as to annihilate and destroy it from the face of the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
