The priests and the Levites brought them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the Holy of Holies, under the wings of the cherubim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the cherubim spread their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered over the ark and its poles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The poles extended so that the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place, in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses had put there at Horeb, when Jehovah had made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, when the priests came out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>such that the priests were not able to stand to minister before the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Solomon spoke: Jehovah has said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have built to establish for You an exalted house, a fixed place for You to abide continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king turned his face around and blessed the whole assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said: Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who has spoke with His mouth to my father David, and with His hand has fulfilled it, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Since the day that I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house, for My name to be there; but I chose David to be over My people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jehovah said to my father David, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well that it was in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall come from your body, he shall build the house for My name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus Jehovah has fulfilled His word which He has spoken; and I have risen up in place of my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah has promised; and I have built a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And there I have fixed a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of Jehovah which He had made with our fathers, when He brought them out from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in front of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and he said: Jehovah the God of Israel, there is no god in the heavens above or on the earth below like You, who keeps Your covenant and mercy with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You have kept what You have promised Your servant David my father; You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore, Jehovah the God of Israel, now keep what You have promised Your servant David my father, saying, You shall not fail to have a man sitting before Me on the throne of Israel, only if your sons take heed to their way, to walk before Me as you have walked before Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now I pray, O God of Israel, let Your word be confirmed, which You have spoken to Your servant David my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But will God truly dwell on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the Heaven of heavens cannot contain You. How much less this house which I have built!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yet regard the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O Jehovah my God, and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You today:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that Your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which You have said, My name shall be there, that You may hear the prayer which Your servant prays toward this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And may You hear the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. Hear in Heaven Your dwelling place; and when You hear, forgive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When anyone sins against his neighbor, and is required to take an oath, and has come to swear an oath before Your altar in this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>then hear in Heaven, and act, and judge Your servants, to condemn the wicked, to bring his way upon his head, and to justify the righteous, giving him according to his righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When Your people Israel are struck down before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and when they turn back to You and confess Your name, and pray and make supplication to You in this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>then hear in Heaven, and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You have given to their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When the heavens are restrained and there is no rain because they have sinned against You; when they have prayed toward this place and confessed Your name, and turned from their sin because You afflicted them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>then hear in Heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain upon Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When there is famine in the land, pestilence or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers; when their enemy besieges them in the land in their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>whatever prayer, whatever supplication is made by anyone, or by all Your people Israel, when each one knows the plague of his own heart, and spreads out his hands toward this house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>then hear in Heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and act, and give to everyone according to all his ways, whose heart You know (for You alone have known the hearts of all the sons of men),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>that they may fear You all the days that they are alive on the face of the land which You have given to our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Moreover, concerning a foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel, but has come from a distant land on account of Your name</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>(for they will hear of Your great name and Your strong hand and Your outstretched arm), when he has come and prayed toward this house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>hear in Heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls upon You, that all peoples of the earth may know Your name to fear You, as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>When Your people go out to battle against their enemy, wherever You send them, and when they pray to Jehovah toward the city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>then hear in Heaven their prayer and their supplication, and attend to their cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>When they sin against You (for there is no one who does not sin), and You have become angry with them and delivered them to the enemy, and they have taken them captive to the land of the enemy, far or near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>yet when they have returned in their minds in the land where they have been carried captive, and have repented in their hearts, and made supplication to You in the land of those holding them captive, saying, We have sinned and done perversely, we have committed wickedness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and when they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who have taken them captive, and have prayed to You toward their land which You have given to their fathers, the city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>then hear in Heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplication, and attend to their cause,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and forgive Your people who have sinned against You, and all their transgressions which they have transgressed against You; and grant them compassion before those who took them captive, that they may have compassion on them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>(for they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You have brought out of Egypt, out of the midst of the iron furnace),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>that Your eyes may be open to the supplication of Your servant and the supplication of Your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they call unto You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For as You have spoken by the hand of Your servant Moses, You have separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be Your inheritance, when You brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And so it was, when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplication unto Jehovah, that he arose before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Blessed is Jehovah, who has given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He has spoken. There has not failed one word of all His good word, which He has spoken by the hand of His servant Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Jehovah our God be with us, as He was with our fathers. May He not leave us nor forsake us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>that He may incline our hearts unto Himself, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments, which He has commanded our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And may these words of mine, with which I have made supplication before Jehovah, be near Jehovah our God day and night, that He may attend to the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel, each matter from day to day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah is God; there is no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Let your heart therefore be perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in His statutes and keep His commandments, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the king and all Israel with him were offering sacrifices before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And Solomon offered sacrifices of peace offerings, which he offered unto Jehovah, twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. Thus the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And for that day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of Jehovah; for there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Jehovah was too small to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven more days; fourteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the good that Jehovah had done for His servant David, and for Israel His people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
