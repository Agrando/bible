Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame of which I have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Happy are your men and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Blessed is Jehovah your God, who has delighted in you, setting you on the throne of Israel! Because of Jehovahs eternal love for Israel, therefore He made you king, to execute justice and righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great quantity, and precious stones. There never again came such abundance of spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, also brought great quantities of almug wood and precious stones from Ophir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king made pillars of the almug wood for the house of Jehovah and for the kings house, and harps and lutes for the singers. There never again came such almug wood, nor has the like been seen to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides what Solomon had given to her according to the hand of the king. So she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>besides that from the traveling merchants, from the income of traders, from all the kings of Arabia, and from the governors of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And King Solomon made two hundred shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the house of the Forest of Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round at the back; there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Twelve lions were standing there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>All King Solomons drinking vessels were gold, and all the vessels of the house of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Not one was silver, for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the king had a fleet of ships at sea from Tarshish along with the fleet of Hiram; and once every three years the ships from Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the earth was seeking the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Each man was bringing his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules, at a set rate year by year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Also Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Mikveh; the kings merchants got them at Mikveh for a price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now a chariot that came up out from Egypt was six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse one hundred and fifty; and thus, by their hand, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
