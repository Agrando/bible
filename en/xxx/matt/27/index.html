And they said, What is that to us? You see to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they took counsel and bought with them the potters field, to bury strangers in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was valued, whom they of the children of Israel valued,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and gave them for the potters field, as the Lord directed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor questioned Him, saying, Are You the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, It is as you say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Pilate said to Him, Do You not hear how many things they witness against You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But He answered him not one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to releasing to the multitude one prisoner whom they wished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he knew that they had delivered Him over because of envy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The governor answered and said to them, Which of the two do you want me to release to you? They said, Barabbas!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all say to him, Let Him be crucified!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the governor said, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out all the more, saying, Let Him be crucified!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but rather that a tumult was rising, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just Person. You see to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the people answered and said, His blood be on us and on our children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he released Barabbas to them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered Him to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when they had woven a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they spat on Him, and took the reed and struck Him on the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. Him they compelled to bear His cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>they gave Him vinegar mixed with gall to drink. But when He had tasted it, He would not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And sitting down, they kept watch over Him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they put up over His head the accusation written against Him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and another on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and saying, You who destroys the temple and builds it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Likewise the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and elders, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He saved others; He has no power to save Himself. If He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now if He will have Him; for He said, I am the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Even the robbers who were crucified with Him reviled Him with the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Some of those who stood there, when they heard that, said, This Man calls for Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The rest said, Let be; let us see if Elijah will come to save Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and were manifest to many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Now when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And many women who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him, were there looking on from afar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jacob and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And when evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself was also a disciple of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. And Pilate commanded the body to be given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, and departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And on the next day, which followed the Day of Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered together to Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>saying, Sir, we remember, while He was still alive, how that deceiver said, After three days I will rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Therefore, command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, that His disciples not come by night and steal Him away, and say to the people, He has risen from the dead. So the last deception will be worse than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Pilate said to them, You have a guard; go your way, make it as secure as you know how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
