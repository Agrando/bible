They make their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They love the chief places at feasts, the chief seats in the synagogues,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you, do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, the Christ, and you are all brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nor be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he who is greater among you shall be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of Heaven against men; for you neither go in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. Therefore you will receive more abundant condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel land and sea to win one proselyte, and when he becomes one, you make him twice more a son of Gehenna than yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Woe to you, blind guides, who say, Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is a debtor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it is a debtor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore he who swears by the altar, swears by it and by all things on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He who swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he who swears by Heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and anise and cumin, and have disregarded the weightier matters of the law: judgment and mercy and faith. It is necessary to do these, and not to leave the others undone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Blind Pharisee, first cleanse the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead mens bones and all uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and say, If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore you are witnesses against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Serpents! Offspring of vipers! How will you escape the condemnation of Gehenna?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore, behold, I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes: some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>in order that on you may come all the righteous blood poured out upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Truly, I say to you, All these things will come upon this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her, how often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Behold, your house is left to you desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For I say to you: You shall see Me no more till you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
