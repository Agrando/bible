Hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. And He left them and departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when His disciples had come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Jesus, being aware of it, said to them, O you of little faith, why do you reason among yourselves because you have brought no bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do you not yet understand, or remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many large baskets you took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread, but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they understood that He did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So they said, Some say John the Immerser, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, But who do you say that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this Rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against It.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be, having been bound in Heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be, having been loosed in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that it was necessary for Him to go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, Far be it from You, Lord; this shall never be to You!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan! You are a snare to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his practice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Truly I say to you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
