And when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot out of the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus said to them, They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they said to Him, We have here only five loaves and two fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, Bring them here to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up into the mountain by Himself to pray. And when evening came, He was there alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost! And they cried out for fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter answered Him and said, Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So He said, Come. And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then those who were in the boat came and did homage to Him, saying, Truly You are the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent out into all that surrounding region, brought to Him all who were sick,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and begged Him that they might only touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched it were made completely well.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
