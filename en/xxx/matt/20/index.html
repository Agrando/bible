So they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why do you stand here idle all day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said to him, Because no one hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So when evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers and give them their wages, beginning with the last to the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received each a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they had received it, they murmured against the landowner,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, These last men have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take what is yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man the same as to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things? Or is your eye evil because I am good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples aside on the road and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify. And the third day He will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the mother of ZebedeeÂ’s sons came to Him with her sons, bowing and asking something from Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And He said to her, What do you wish? She said to Him, Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on the left, in Your kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus answered and said, You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with? They said to Him, We are able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He said to them, You will indeed drink My cup, and be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the ten heard it, they were indignant about the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus called them to Himself and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as they went out of Jericho, a great multitude followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the multitude warned them that they should be quiet; but they cried out all the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus stood still and called them, and said, What do you want Me to do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They said to Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes. And immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
