And His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, Behold, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>how he entered the house of God and ate the Bread of Presentation which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if you had known what this means, I desire mercy and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when He had departed from there, He went into their synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand. And they asked Him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? that they might accuse Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And He said to them, What man is there among you who has one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How much more, then, does a man excel a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out, and it was restored whole, as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the Pharisees went out and held a council against Him, how they might destroy Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when Jesus knew it, He withdrew from there. And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed everyone of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He warned them not to make Him known,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul is well pleased! I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will declare judgment to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench, till He sends forth judgment to victory;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and in His name the Gentiles will hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then one was brought to Him who was demon-possessed, blind and mute; and He healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the multitudes were amazed and said, Is this not the Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the Pharisees heard it they said, This one does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or how can one enter a strong manÂ’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for a tree is known by its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Offspring of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But He answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold one greater than Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold one greater than Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he says, I will return to my house from which I came out. And when he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be unto this wicked generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While He was still talking to the multitudes, behold, His mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then one said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But He answered and said to the one who told Him, Who is My mother and who are My brothers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And He stretched out His hand toward His disciples and said, Here are My mother and My brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For whoever does the will of My Father in Heaven, that one is My brother and sister and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
