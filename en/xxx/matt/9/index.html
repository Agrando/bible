When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, Son, be of good courage; your sins are forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And at once some of the scribes said within themselves, This Man blasphemes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you think evil in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Arise and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins; then He said to the paralytic, Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he arose and departed to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, Follow Me. So he arose and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it happened, as Jesus sat at the table in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Him and His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Jesus heard it, He said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But go and learn what this means: I desire mercy and not sacrifice. For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins break, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While He spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler came and did homage to Him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her and she will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Jesus arose and followed him, and so did His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And behold, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For she said within herself, If only I may touch His garment, I shall be made well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, Be of good courage, daughter; your faith has made you well. And the woman was made well from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Jesus came into the rulerÂ’s house, and saw the flute players and the crowd wailing loudly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He said to them, Make room, for the girl has not died, but is sleeping. And they ridiculed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when the crowd was put outside, He went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the report of this went out into all that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, Son of David, have mercy on us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when He had come into the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? And they said to Him, Yes, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then He touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith let it be to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly ordered them, saying, See that no one knows it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But when they had departed, they spread the news about Him in all that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And as they went out, behold, they brought to Him a man, mute and demon-possessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never seen like this in Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharisees said, He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And He said to His disciples, The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
