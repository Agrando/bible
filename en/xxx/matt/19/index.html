Therefore what God has yoked together, let not man separate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said to Him, Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you, whoever puts away his wife, except for sexual perversion, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples said to Him, If such is the case of the man with his wife, it is not good to marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But He said to them, Not all have room to receive this saying, but only those to whom it has been given:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their motherÂ’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of Heaven. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then little children were brought to Him that He might lay His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He laid His hands on them and departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And behold, one came and said to Him, Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So He said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to Him, Which? Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Honor your father and your mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man said to Him, All these things I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven; and come, follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus said to His disciples, Truly, I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When His disciples heard it, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jesus looked at them and said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter answered and said to Him, Behold, we have left everything and followed You. What then will there be for us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My name, shall receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many who are first will be last, and the last first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
