Truly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus answered and said to them: Take heed that no one leads you astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and will lead many astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All these are the beginning of travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they will deliver you up to affliction and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And many false prophets will rise up and lead many astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he who endures to the end shall be kept safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (whoever reads, let him understand),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then let those who are in Judea flee into the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For then there will be great affliction, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be kept safe alive; but for the electÂ’s sake those days will be shortened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then if anyone says to you, Look, here is the Christ; or, There; do not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For false christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, I have told you beforehand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore if they say to you, Behold, He is in the desert, do not go out; or, Behold, He is in the inner rooms, do not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as the lightning comes out of the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And immediately after the affliction of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the heavens, and then all the tribes of the earth will wail, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Truly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Heaven and earth will pass away, but My Words will by no means pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of Heaven, but My Father only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and did not realize until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then two will be in the field: one is taken and the other is left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Two will be grinding at the mill: one is taken and the other is left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief comes, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be dug through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man comes at an hour you do not expect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master made administrator over his household, to give them food in due season?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Truly, I say to you that he will appoint him as administrator over all his possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But if that wicked servant says in his heart, My master delays his coming,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not expecting him and in an hour he does not know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
