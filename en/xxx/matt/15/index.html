For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by reason of your tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you say, Whoever says to his father or mother, Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and he does not honor his father or mother. Thus you have voided the commandment of God by your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>These people draw near to Me with their mouth, and honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And in vain they revere Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when He had called the multitude to Himself, He said to them, Hear and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then His disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But He answered and said, Every plant which My Heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into the ditch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Peter answered and said to Him, Explain this parable to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jesus said, Are you also still without understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated into the sewer?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual perversions, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, a woman of Canaan came from those borders and cried out to Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is grievously demon-possessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, Send her away, for she cries out after us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But He answered and said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then she came and did homage to Him, saying, Lord, help me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But He answered and said, It is not good to take the childrens bread and throw it to the little dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But she said, Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire. And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus departed from there, came beside the Sea of Galilee, and went up into the mountain and sat down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And great multitudes came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others; and they cast them down at Jesus feet, and He healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus called His disciples to Himself and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, that they not faint on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And His disciples said to Him, Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a great multitude?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few little fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks, broke them and gave them to His disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So they all ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets full of the fragments that were left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And He sent away the multitude, got into the boat, and came to the borders of Magdala.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
