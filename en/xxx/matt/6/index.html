Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore, when you do a deed of mercy, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have praise from men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But when you do a deed of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand does,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>that your deed of mercy may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when you pray, do not babble vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In this manner, therefore, pray: Our Father in Heaven, Holy is Your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Give us this day our bread sufficient for this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves dig through and steal;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not dig through and steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No one is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. It is not possible to serve God and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Observe the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your Heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Which of you by being anxious is able to add one cubit to his stature?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your Heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
