For it is written: He shall give His angels charge concerning you, and, in their hands they shall bear you up, that you may not dash your foot against a stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to him, It is written again, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again, the devil takes Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and shows Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he says to Him, All these things I will give to You if You will fall down and do homage to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to him, Go away, Satan! For it has been written, You shall do homage to the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up to prison, He withdrew into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The people who sat in darkness have seen a great Light, and upon those sitting in the region and shadow of death, Light has sprung up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven has drawn near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And He says to them, Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they immediately left their nets and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And going on from there, He saw two other brothers, Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus went around all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all the sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And great multitudes followed Him; from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
