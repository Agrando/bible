Come to the wedding feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when the king heard about it, he was angry. And he sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said to his servants, The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found, both evil and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many are called, but few are chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle Him in His words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that You are true, and teach the way of God in truth; nor do You care about anyone, for You do not regard the person of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why do you test Me, hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show Me the tribute money. So they brought Him a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And He said to them, Whose image and inscription is this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They said to Him, Caesars. And He said to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they had heard these words, they marveled, and left Him and went their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying: Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there were with us seven brothers. The first died after he had married, and having no seed, left his wife to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise the second also, and the third, even to the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered and said to them, You are in error, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels of God in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at His doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the first and great commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, What do you think about the Christ? Whose Son is He? They said to Him, The Son of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He said to them, How then does David in the Spirit call Him Lord, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If David then calls Him Lord, how is He his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor from that day on did anyone dare question Him anymore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
