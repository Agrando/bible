Loose them and bring them to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them, and immediately he will send them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King is coming to you, meek, and sitting on a donkey, a colt, the foal of a donkey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they led the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the multitudes said, This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He said to them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! they were indignant</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and said to Him, Do You hear what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, Yes. Have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now in the morning, as He returned to the city, He hungered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And seeing a fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves, and said to it, Let fruit no longer grow on you forever. And immediately the fig tree dried up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How quickly the fig tree has dried up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, Be removed and be cast into the sea, it will happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when He came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached Him as He was teaching, and said, By what authority do You do these things? And who gave You this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The immersion of John; where was it from? From Heaven or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From Heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if we say, From men, we fear the multitude, for everyone holds John as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So they answered Jesus and said, We do not know. And He said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, Son, go, work today in my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He answered and said, I will not, but afterward he regretted it and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir, but he did not go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which of the two did the will of his father? They said to Him, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you that tax collectors and harlots enter the kingdom of God before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and harlots believed him; and when you saw it, you did not afterward repent and believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hear another parable: There was a certain landowner who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a winepress in it and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now when the season of fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the vinedressers took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did likewise to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then last of all he sent his son to them, saying, They will respect my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They said to Him, He will destroy those wicked men miserably, and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers who will deliver to him the fruits in their seasons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner. This was the LordÂ’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation producing the fruits of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will crush him to pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But when they sought to lay hands on Him, they feared the multitudes, because they held Him as a prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
