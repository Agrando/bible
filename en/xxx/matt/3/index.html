Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore bring forth fruits worthy of repentance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now already the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore any tree which does not bear good fruit is cut off and thrown into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I indeed immerse you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>whose winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the granary; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus comes from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be immersed by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But John tried to prevent Him, saying, I need to be immersed by You, and do You come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jesus answered and said to him, Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allowed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when He had been immersed, Jesus went up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And behold a voice out of heaven, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
