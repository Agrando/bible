A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kingsÂ’ houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Immerser; but he who is least in the kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And from the days of John the Immerser until now the kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah who is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and saying: We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned to you, and you did not lament.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of Man comes eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a glutton and a wino, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! But wisdom is justified by her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then He began to rebuke the cities in which most of His mighty works had been done, because they did not repent:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades; for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank You, Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to babes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest unto your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
