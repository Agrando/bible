For she has done a good work toward Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For you have the poor with you always, but you do not always have Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For in pouring this ointment on My body, she did it for My burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Truly, I say to you, Wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and said, What will you give me, and I will deliver Him to you? And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now on the first day of the Feast of the Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And He said, Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and prepared the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When evening had come, He sat down with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as they were eating, He said, Truly, I say to you, One of you will betray Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and each of them began to say to Him, Lord, it is not I is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He answered and said, He who dips his hand with Me in the dish will betray Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It had been good for that man if he was never born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, Rabbi, it is not I is it? He said to him, You have said it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink all of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this is My blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I say to you, I will not at all drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Fathers kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to them, All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written: I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I have been raised, I will go before you into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Peter answered and said to Him, Even if all are made to stumble because of You, I will never be made to stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter said to Him, Even if I have to die with You, I will not at all deny You! And so said all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, Sit here while I go and pray over there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and He began to be sorrowful and in extreme anguish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death. Stay here and watch with Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And He came to the disciples and found them asleep, and said to Peter, What? Were you not able to watch with Me one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch and pray, that you not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then He came to His disciples and said to them, Sleep on and rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Arise, let us be going. Behold, My betrayer is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And immediately he went up to Jesus and said, Greetings, Rabbi; and kissed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But Jesus said to him, Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Or do you think that I am not able now to pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, Have you come out, as against a robber, to take Me with swords and clubs? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all this is happening that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And those who had laid hold of Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Peter followed Him at a distance to the high priests courtyard. And he went in and sat with the servants to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Now the chief priests, the elders, and all the council sought false testimony against Jesus to put Him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>but found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the high priest arose and said to Him, Do You answer nothing? What is it these men bear witness against You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, I adjure You by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus said to him, You said it. Nevertheless, I say to you, Hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard His blasphemy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What is your opinion? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then they spat in His face and beat Him with the fist; and others slapped Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying, Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who struck You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied it before them all, saying, I do not know what you are saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And when he had gone out to the porch, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And a little later those who stood by came up and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them, for your speech betrays you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then he began to curse and swear, saying, I do not know the Man! And immediately a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus who had said to him, Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
