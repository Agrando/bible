Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and behold He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to report this to His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as they went to bring word to His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Greetings! And they came and held Him by the feet and did homage to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, Say, His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we slept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if this comes to the governorÂ’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free from anxiety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw Him, they did homage to Him; but some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority is given to Me in Heaven and on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go therefore and instruct all the nations, immersing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
