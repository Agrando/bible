For we have seen His star in the East and have come to do homage to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least among the leaders of Judah; for out of you shall come One leading Who will shepherd My people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, asked of them exactly what time the star appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you find Him, bring back word to me, that I may come and do homage to Him also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and did homage to Him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And being warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed for their own country another way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, take the Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod is about to seek the young Child in order to destroy Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed into Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt I called My Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was greatly enraged; and he sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired from the wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>saying, Arise, take the young Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young ChildÂ’s life are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he arose, took the young Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
