It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a grain measure, but on a lampstand, and it shines for all who are in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let your light so shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For truly I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the Law till all is fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whoever therefore relaxes one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of Heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, Empty head! shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, You fool! shall be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Truly I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if your right eye snares you into sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if your right hand snares you into sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Furthermore it has been said, Whoever puts away his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I say to you that whoever puts away his wife for any reason except sexual perversion causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Again, you have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by Heaven, for it is GodÂ’s throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Nor shall you swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But let your word be Yes, yes; No, no. For whatever is more than these is from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I tell you, Do not resist evil. But whoever hits you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And if anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic, let him have your cloak also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Give to him who asks of you, and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who abuse you and persecute you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>that you may become sons of your Father in Heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not also the tax collectors so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in Heaven is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
