His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were greatly terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise, and do not be terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is risen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And His disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, Indeed, Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. Likewise the Son of Man is also about to suffer under them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them of John the Immerser.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they had come to the multitude, a man came to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is lunatic and suffers miserably; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I brought him to Your disciples, but they were not able to cure him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him; and the child was cured from that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, Why could we not cast it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief; for truly I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they will kill Him, and the third day He will be raised up. And they were exceedingly sorrowful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they had come to Capernaum, those who received the tribute came to Peter and said, Does your Teacher not pay the tribute?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said, Yes. And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from strangers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Peter said to Him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then the sons are free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Nevertheless, that we not offend them, go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for Me and you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
