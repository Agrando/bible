This is that which was sown by the wayside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That which was sown on stony places, this is he who hears the Word and immediately receives it with joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. For when affliction or persecution arises because of the Word, immediately he stumbles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And that which was sown among the thorns is he who hears the Word, and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the Word, and he becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But that which was sown on the good ground is he who hears the Word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: this a hundredfold, that sixty, that thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Another parable He put forth to them, saying: The kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the grain had sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares also appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the servants of the owner came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Do you want us then to go and gather them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he said, No, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another parable He put forth to them, saying: The kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>which indeed is the smallest of all the seeds; but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of Heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables; and without a parable He did not speak to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things kept secret from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answered and said to them: He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The field is the world, the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the wicked one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all the stumbling blocks, and those who practice lawlessness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells everything he has and buys that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold everything he had and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some of every kind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>which, when it was full, they drew to shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the rotten away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go forth, separate the wicked from among the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus said to them, Have you understood all these things? They said to Him, Yes, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then He said to them, Therefore every scribe instructed concerning the kingdom of Heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure new and old things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, that He departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when He had come to His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, Where did this Man get this wisdom and these mighty works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is this not the carpenterÂ’s son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brothers Jacob, Joses, Simon, and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this Man get all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>So they were offended in Him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
