Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus said to him, See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, begging Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>saying, Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, being terribly tormented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jesus said to him, I will come and heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you. And his servant was healed that same hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Jesus had come into Peters house, He saw his wifes mother lying sick with a fever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed everyone who was sick,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Jesus saw great multitudes around Him, He gave a command to depart to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And a certain scribe came and said to Him, Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And another of His disciples said to Him, Lord, let me first go away and bury my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus said to him, Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, behold, a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, Lord, save us! We are perishing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And He said to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the men marveled, saying, Of what sort is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when He had come to the other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demon-possessed men, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with You, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And a good way off from them there was a herd of many swine feeding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the demons begged Him, saying, If You cast us out, allow us to go away into the herd of swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And He said to them, Go. So when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine. And, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and perished in the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then those who kept them fled; and they went away into the city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart out of their borders.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
