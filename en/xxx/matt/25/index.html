Enter into the joy of your lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He also who had received two talents came and said, Lord, you delivered to me two talents; behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will appoint you administrator over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he who had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Behold, there you have what is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But his lord answered and said to him, You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the King will say to those on His right hand, Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>for I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the King will answer and say to them, Truly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then He will also say to those on the left hand, Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for I was hungry and you did not give Me a thing to eat; I was thirsty and you did not give Me a thing to drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then they also will answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then He will answer them, saying, Truly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
