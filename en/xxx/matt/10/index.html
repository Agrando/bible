Freely you have received, freely give.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Provide neither gold nor silver nor copper in your money belts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staffs; for a worker is worthy of his food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And into whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there till you go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when you go into a house, greet it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If the house is truly worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and scourge you in their synagogues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you should speak, for it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and put them to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you will be hated by everyone on account of My name. But he who endures to the end will be kept safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For truly I say to you, you will not have finished going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is enough for a disciple that he be like his teacher, and a servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be uncovered, and hidden that will not be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whatever I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And do not fear those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul. But rather fear Him who has power to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them shall fall to the ground without your Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore whoever shall confess Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and a mans enemies will be those of his own household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life on account of Me will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophets reward. And he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
