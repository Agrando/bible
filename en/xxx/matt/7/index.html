First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the twig from your brothers eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in Heaven give good things to those who ask Him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many entering in through it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Because narrow is the gate and distressing is the way which leads unto life, and there are few who find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will know them from their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so, every good tree produces excellent fruit, but a corrupt tree produces evil fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree is not able to produce evil fruit, nor is a corrupt tree able to produce excellent fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree that does not produce excellent fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore from their fruits you will know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of Heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many works of power in Your name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And then I will declare to them, I never knew you; depart from Me, you who work out lawlessness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be likened to a foolish man who built his house on the sand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house; and it fell. And great was its fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the multitudes were astonished at His doctrine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
