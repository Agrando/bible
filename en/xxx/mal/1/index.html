Yet you say, In what way have You loved us? Was not Esau the brother to Jacob? says Jehovah; yet I loved Jacob,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and I have hated Esau and have made his mountains and his inheritance a desolation for the jackals of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Whereas Edom says, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus says Jehovah of Hosts: They shall build, but I will tear down. And they shall call them the region of wickedness, and the people with whom Jehovah has indignation forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And your eyes shall see, and you shall say, Jehovah will be magnified beyond the border of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is My fear? says Jehovah of Hosts to you, O priests who despise My name. But you say, In what way have we despised Your name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You offer defiled food on My altar, and say, In what way have we defiled You? By saying, The table of Jehovah is to be held in contempt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if you offer the blind in sacrifice, is it not evil? And if you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil? Bring it now to your governor. Will he be pleased with you or receive you favorably? says Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now entreat the face of the Mighty God, that He may be gracious to us. This has been by your hands; will He receive you favorably? says Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who is there even among you that will shut the doors, so that you not kindle fire on My altar in vain? I have no pleasure in you, says Jehovah of Hosts, nor will I accept a food offering from your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For from the east to the west, My name shall be great among the nations, and everywhere incense shall be offered to My name; and a pure food offering; for My name shall be great among the nations, says Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But you profane it when you say, The table of the Lord is defiled; and its fruit, His food is to be held in contempt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you have said, Behold, what weariness. And you have sniffed at it, says Jehovah of Hosts. And you bring what was stolen, and the lame, and the sick; and you bring the grain offering. Should I accept it from your hand? says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But cursed be a deceiver when there is a male in his flock, he vows it, but sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished. For I am a great King, says Jehovah of Hosts, and My name is feared among the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
