And how have I made you weary? Testify against Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage; and I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My people, remember now what Balak, king of Moab, counseled; and what Balaam, the son of Beor, answered him from Shittim to Gilgal, so that you may know the righteousness of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>With what shall I come before Jehovah, to bow myself before the loftiness of God? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with yearling calves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>O man, He has declared to you what is good. And what does Jehovah require of you, but to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The voice of Jehovah cries out to the city; and one of sound wisdom will see Your name. Hear the staff, and Him who appointed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Are there yet in the house of the wicked the treasures of wickedness, and the abominable short ephah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Shall I declare to be pure the wicked balances, or the bag of deceitful weight stones?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For her rich ones are full of violence, and her inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore I also will make you sick by striking you, making you desolate because of your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall eat, but not be satisfied, and your emptiness shall be in your midst; and you will move back, but shall not be safe; and that which you rescue, I will give to the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You shall sow, but you shall not reap; you shall tread the olive, but you shall not anoint yourselves with oil; and new wine, but shall not drink wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab.
