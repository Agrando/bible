In the morning light they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they covet and seize fields and houses, and carry them away. And they oppress a man and his household, even a man and his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am devising evil against this family, from which you shall not remove your necks; nor shall you walk haughtily, for this is an evil time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In that day one shall take up a parable against you and wail a mournful lamentation, saying, We are devastated in utter ruin. He has changed the possession of my people. How He has removed it from me! To the turncoat He has divided the fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore you will not have one to cast a measuring line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not prophesy as you prophesy, you say. So they shall not prophesy to you; they shall not take away reproaches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You who are named House of Jacob, is the Spirit of Jehovah limited? Are these His doings? Do not My Words do good to the one who walks uprightly?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Even recently My people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off an inner robe before an outer garment, from those who pass by securely, as those returning from war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You have thrown the women of My people out from their pleasant houses; you have taken away My honor forever from their children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Rise up and depart. This is not your rest, for it is unclean. It shall destroy with grievous destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If a man walks with a spirit of deception and lies saying, I will prophesy to you for wine and for strong drink, he shall even be a prophet for this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will collect and gather all of you, O Jacob; I will collect and gather the remnant of Israel. I will set them together like the sheep of the fold, like a flock in the middle of their pasture. They shall be in commotion because of the multitude of people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The one who breaks through comes before them; they break through and pass through the gate and go out by it. And their king shall pass before them, and Jehovah at their head.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
