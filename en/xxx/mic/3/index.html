He will even hide His face from them at that time, because they have done evil in their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says Jehovah concerning the prophets who mislead My people, who bite with their teeth and call out, Peace! And whoever does not put anything into their mouth, they even prepare a war against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore the night shall be to you without vision; and darkness without divining.
