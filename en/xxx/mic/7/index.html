For I am like the gatherings of summer fruit, like the gleanings of the vintage. There is no cluster to eat; my soul desires the first-ripe fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The good man has perished from the earth, and there is no one upright among mankind. All of them lie in wait for blood; each one hunts his brother with a net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Both hands are on evil, to do it well. Both the ruler and the judge ask for a bribe. And the great one speaks the lust of his soul; and they weave it together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The best of them is like a thorn; the upright more than a hedge of thorns. The day of your watchman and your punishment comes; now shall be their perplexity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Put no faith in a companion; put no trust in a friend; keep the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>for the son dishonors the father; the daughter rises up against her mother; the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a manÂ’s enemies are the men of his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But I will look to Jehovah; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do not rejoice against me, O my enemy; for if I fall, I shall arise. For if I sit in darkness, Jehovah is a light to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will bear the indignation of Jehovah because I have sinned against Him, until He pleads my case and executes justice for me. He will bring me forth to the light; I shall see His righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And my enemy shall see; and shame shall cover her who said to me, Where is Jehovah your God? My eyes shall see her. Now she shall be trampled down as the mud of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In the day your walls are to be built, in that day the decree shall be far removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day they shall come to you from Assyria and the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the River, and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the land shall become desolate because of those who dwell in it, from the fruit of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Shepherd Your people with Your rod, the flock of Your possession, who dwell alone in the woodland, in the midst of Carmel. Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As in the days when you came out from the land of Egypt, I will show them marvelous things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The nations shall see and be put to shame for all their might. They shall lay their hand over their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They shall lick the dust like a snake; they shall tremble out from their holes like ones that shrink back into the earth; they shall dread Jehovah our God; they shall fear because of You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who is a Mighty God like You, forgiving iniquity and passing over the transgression of the remnant of His possession? His anger does not remain strong forever, for He delights in mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will return and have compassion on us; He will subdue our iniquities. And You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You will give faithfulness to Jacob, goodness to Abraham, which You have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
