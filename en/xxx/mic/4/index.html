And He will teach us His ways, and we will walk in His paths. For the Law shall go forth out of Zion, and the Word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He shall judge between many peoples, and will decide for strong nations afar off. And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, nor shall they learn war any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they shall each one sit under his vine and under his fig tree, and there shall be no cause for trembling. For the mouth of Jehovah of Hosts has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For all the peoples walk, each one in the name of his god; but we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In that day I will gather the lame, declares Jehovah, and I will gather the banished, and the ones I have afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will establish the lame in a place as a remnant, and her who was cast off into a strong nation. And Jehovah shall reign over them in Mount Zion from now on, even forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you, O tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, it shall come to you. And the rule of the chief ones shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now why do you cry aloud with an outcry? Is there no king among you? Has your adviser perished? For pangs have seized you like one in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Writhe in pain and bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like one giving birth. For now you shall go out from the city, and you shall live in the field. And you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be delivered. There Jehovah shall redeem you from the hand of your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now also many nations are gathered against you, saying, Let her be defiled, and let our eyes look upon Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But they do not know the purposes of Jehovah, nor do they understand His counsel. For He will gather them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Rise up and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hooves bronze, and you shall crush many peoples. And I will consecrate their gain to Jehovah, and their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
