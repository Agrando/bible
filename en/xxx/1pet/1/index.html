Though now you do not see Him yet, believing, you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>receiving the outcome of your faith; the salvation of your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Of this salvation the prophets have sought out and searched diligently, who prophesied concerning the grace towards you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>searching for what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ who was in them was indicating when He testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glories after these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To them it was revealed that, not to themselves, but to us they were ministering the things which now have been reported to you through those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from Heaven; things which angels desire to look into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and rest your hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts in your ignorance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but as He who called you is holy, you also become holy in all conduct,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because it is written, Be holy, because I am holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each oneÂ’s work, behave yourselves throughout the time of your sojourning in fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold, from your vain way of life received by tradition from your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who through Him believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto sincere love of the brethren, love one another fervently out of a pure heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the Word of God which lives and abides forever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>because All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but the Word of the Lord endures forever. Now this is the Word which by the gospel was preached to you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
