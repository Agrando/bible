They stumble, being disobedient to the Word, to which they also were appointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people of His possession, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who once were not a people but are now the people of God, who did not have mercy but now have mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and sojourners, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>having your behavior honorable among the Gentiles, that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by your good works which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man because of the Lord; whether to the king as supreme,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>as free, yet not using liberty as a pretext for evil, but as bondservants of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and fair, but also to the perverse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For this is commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering undeservedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For what praise is it if, when you are beaten for your faults, you endure it patiently? But when you do good and suffer, if you endure it patiently, this is favorable with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but gave Himself over to Him who judges righteously;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
