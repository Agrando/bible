And do not be afraid of their terror, nor be troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>having a good conscience, that when they speak against you as evildoers, those who falsely accuse your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who formerly were disobedient, when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There is also an antitype which now saves us; immersion (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who has gone into Heaven and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
