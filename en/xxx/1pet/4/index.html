If anyone ministers, let him do it as with the strength which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Beloved, do not be astonished at the fiery trial which is to try you, as though something unheard of was happening to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but rejoice in so far as you partake of Christs sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also rejoice with exceeding joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. According to them He is blasphemed, but according to you He is glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a meddler in other peoples matters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this regard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now if the righteous one is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
