Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus to himself, God, I thank You that I am not like other men; extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to Heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then they also brought infants to Him that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus called them to Him and said, Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Truly, I say to you, Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now a certain ruler asked Him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One: God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, All these things I have kept from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So when Jesus heard these things, He said to him, You still lack one thing. Sell everything that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven; and come, follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he heard this, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, He said, How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And those who heard it said, Who then is able to be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And He said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter said, See, we have left all and followed You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So He said to them, Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, on account of the kingdom of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the age to come eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For He will be delivered up to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They will scourge Him and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know the things which were spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then it happened, as He was coming near Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the road begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what it might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he cried out, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those who went before rebuked him that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>saying, What do you want Me to do for you? He said, Lord, that I may recover my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then Jesus said to him, Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately he recovered his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
