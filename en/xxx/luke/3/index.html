Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the multitudes asked him, saying, What shall we do then?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered and said to them, He who has two tunics, let him give to him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then tax collectors also came to be immersed, and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to them, Collect no more than what is appointed for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Likewise the soldiers asked him, saying, And what shall we do? So he said to them, Do not intimidate anyone or accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now as the people were in expectation, and all reasoned in their hearts about John, whether or not he was the Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>John answered, saying to them all, I indeed immerse you in water; but One mightier than I is coming, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loosen. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor, and gather the wheat into His barn; but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And with many other exhortations he preached to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him concerning Herodias, his brother PhilipÂ’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>also added this, above all, that he shut John up in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now when all the people were immersed, it came to pass that Jesus also was immersed; and while He prayed, the Heaven was opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from Heaven which said, You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus Himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Janna, the son of Joseph,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the son of Mattathiah, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>the son of Maath, the son of Mattathiah, the son of Semei, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the son of Joannas, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>the son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattathah, the son of Nathan, the son of David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
