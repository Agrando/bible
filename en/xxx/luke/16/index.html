Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? For my master is taking the stewardship away from me. I am not able to dig; I am ashamed to beg.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I know what to do, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he called every one of his masters debtors to him, and said to the first, How much do you owe my master?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said, A hundred measures of oil. So he said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? So he said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take your bill, and write eighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the master commended the unjust steward because he had acted prudently. For the sons of this world are more prudent in their generation than the sons of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon, that when it fails, they may receive you into eternal dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if you have not been faithful in what is another mans, who will give you what is your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No servant is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. It is not possible to serve God and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they derided Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Law and the Prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is pressing into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But it is easier for Heaven and earth to pass away than for one point of the Law to fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is put away from her husband commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, full of sores, who was laid at his gate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So it happened that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abrahams bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And being in torments in Hades, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Abraham said, Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and you are tormented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And besides all this, between us and you there is a great chasm fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, nor can those from there pass to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said, I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my fathers house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, that they not also come to this place of torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, No, father Abraham; but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one should rise from the dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
