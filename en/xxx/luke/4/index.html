And in those days He ate nothing, and afterward, when they had ended, He was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the devil said to Him, If You are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the devil, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the devil said to Him, All this authority I will give You, and their glory; for this has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore, if You will do homage before me, all will be Yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, Get behind Me, Satan! For it is written, You shall do homage to the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the wing of the temple, and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it is written: He shall give His angels charge concerning you, to guard you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and, In their hands they shall bear you up, that you may not dash your foot against a stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, It has been said, You shall not test the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from Him until an opportune time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news of Him went out through all the surrounding region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free with deliverance those who are oppressed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And He closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And He began to say to them, Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all bore witness to Him, and marveled at the gracious words going forth out of His mouth. And they said, Is this not Josephs son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He said to them, You will surely say this proverb to Me, Physician, heal yourself. Whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in Your country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And He said, Truly, I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I tell you truly, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine throughout all the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but to none of them was Elijah sent except to Zarephath, in the region of Sidon, to a widow woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And many lepers were in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with rage,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and rose up and thrust Him out of the city; and they led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, in order to throw Him down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But passing through the midst of them, He went His way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were astonished at His teaching, for His word was with authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>saying, Leave us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are; the Holy One of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him! And when the demon had thrown him into their midst, it came out of him and did not hurt him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word this is. For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the report about Him went out into every place in the surrounding region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And He arose from the synagogue and entered Simons house. And Simons wifes mother was sick with a high fever, and they entreated Him concerning her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she arose and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on every one of them and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, You are the Christ, the Son of God! And He, rebuking them, did not allow them to speak, for they knew that He was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when it was day, He departed and went into a deserted place. And the crowd sought Him and came to Him, and tried to keep Him from leaving them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>but He said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because for this purpose I have been sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
