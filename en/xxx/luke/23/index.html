He answered him and said, It is as you say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, I find no fault in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they were the more insistent, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the Man were a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as soon as he knew that He belonged to HerodÂ’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad; for he had desired for a long time to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and he hoped to see some sign done by Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Herod, with his men of war, treated Him with contempt and mocked Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the same day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity with each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>said to them, You have brought this Man to me, as one who misleads the people. And indeed, having examined Him in your presence, I have found no fault in this Man concerning those things of which you accuse Him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>no, neither did Herod, for I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing deserving of death has been done by Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will therefore chastise Him and release Him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(for it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they all cried out at once, saying, Away with this Man, and release to us Barabbas;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion made in the city, and for murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they shouted, saying, Crucify Him, crucify Him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he said to them the third time, Why, what evil has He done? I have found no reason for death in Him. I will therefore chastise Him and let Him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And the voices of these men and of the chief priests prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they requested.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he released to them the one they requested, who for rebellion and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it behind Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also mourned and bewailed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For behold the days are coming in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, wombs that never bore, and breasts which never nursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! and to the hills, Cover us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if they do these things in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There were also two others, criminals, led with Him to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they had come to the place called Skull, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they divided His garments and cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the people stood looking on. Moreover the rulers with them sneered, saying, He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him vinegar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and saying, If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done nothing wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you, Today you will be with Me in Paradise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said, Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit. Having said this, He breathed out the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, Truly this was a righteous Man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the whole crowd who came together to that sight, seeing the things that happened, beat their breasts and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But all His acquaintances, and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And behold, there was a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and just man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He had not consented to their decision and deed. He was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he took it down, wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever lain before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And that day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And they returned and prepared spices and ointments. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
