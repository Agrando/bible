And He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Simon answered and said to Him, Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and so also were Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Do not fear. From now on you will be catching men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it happened when He was in a certain city, that behold, a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus, fell on his face and begged Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You are able to cleanse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then He put out His hand and touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed. Immediately the leprosy left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He charged him to tell no one, But go and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>However, the report went around concerning Him all the more; and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of their infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He withdrew Himself into the wilderness and prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it happened on a certain day, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, whom they sought to bring in and lay before Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when they could not find how they might bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the housetop and let him down with his bed through the tiling into the midst before Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And seeing their faith, He said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins but God alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But knowing their thoughts, answering, Jesus said to them, Why are you reasoning in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Which is easier; to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Rise up and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins; He said to the man who was paralyzed, I say to you, Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Immediately he rose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen incredible things today!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after these things He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, Follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So he left all, rose up, and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Levi made Him a great feast in his own house. And there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against His disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then they said to Him, Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And He said to them, Can you make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He spoke a parable to them: No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise the new makes a tear, and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But new wine must be put into new wineskins, and both are preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And no one, having drunk old wine, immediately desires new; for he says, The old is better.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
