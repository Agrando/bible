So he sought to see Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the apostles, when they had returned, told Him all that they had done. Then He took them and went aside privately into a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when the multitudes knew it, they followed Him; and He received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the day began to wear away, the twelve came and said to Him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding towns and country, and lodge and get provisions; for we are in a deserted place here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But He said to them, You give them something to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For there were about five thousand men. But He said to His disciples, Make them sit down in groups of fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they did so, and made them all sit down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they all ate and were filled, and twelve baskets of the leftover fragments were taken up by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it happened, as He was alone praying, that His disciples were with Him, and He asked them, saying, Who do the crowds say that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So they answered and said, John the Immerser, but some say Elijah; and others say that one of the old time prophets has risen again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said, The Christ of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And He strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>saying, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then He said to them all, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of Me will save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and is himself destroyed or suffers loss?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His glory, and that of His Father, and of the holy angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass, about eight days after these words, that He took Peter and John and Jacob and went up into the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as He prayed, the appearance of His face was altered, and His robe was blindingly white.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold, two men talked with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>who appeared in glory and spoke of His departure which He was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it happened, as they were parting from Him, that Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah; not knowing what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son. Hear Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And after the voice came, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And behold, a man from the multitude cried out, saying, Teacher, I beg You, look upon my son, for he is my only child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And behold, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it throws him into convulsions with foaming, bruises him, and hardly ever departs from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So I begged Your disciples to cast it out, but they were not able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And as he was still coming, the demon tore him and convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Let these words sink down into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they might not perceive it; and they feared to ask Him about this saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then there began a reasoning among them as to which of them might be greater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a little child and set him beside Himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and said to them, Whoever receives this little child in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me. For he who is least among you all will be great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And John answered and said, Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus said to him, Do not forbid him, for whoever is not against us is for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass, when the time had come for Him to be lifted up, that He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and sent messengers before His face. And as they went, they entered a village of the Samaritans, to prepare for Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>But they did not receive Him, because His face was set for the journey to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when His disciples Jacob and John saw this, they said, Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from Heaven and consume them, just as Elijah did?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But He turned and rebuked them, and said, You do not know what sort of spirit you are of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For the Son of Man did not come to destroy menÂ’s lives but to save them. And they went to another village.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And it happened as they journeyed on the road, that someone said to Him, Lord, I will follow You wherever You go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And He said to another, Follow Me. But he said, Lord, let me first go and bury my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead, but you go and preach the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And another also said, Lord, I will follow You, but let me first go and bid farewell to those who are at my house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>But Jesus said to him, No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
