If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day returns to you, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the apostles said to the Lord, Give us more faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the Lord said, If you have faith as a mustard seed, you might say to this sycamine tree, Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea, and it would obey you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come, sit down to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But will he not rather say to him, Prepare something for my supper, and gird yourself and serve me till I have eaten and drunk, and afterward you will eat and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So likewise you, when you have done all those things which you are commanded, say, We are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now it happened as He went to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they lifted up their voices and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So when He saw them, He said to them, Go, show yourselves to the priests. And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks. And he was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Jesus answered and said, Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And He said to him, Arise, go your way. Your faith has made you well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>nor will they say, See here; or, See there; for behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And He said to the disciples, The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they will say to you, Look here; or, Look there. Do not go away nor follow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For as the lightning that flashes out of one part under the heavens, shines to the other part under the heavens, so also the Son of Man will be in His day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first He must suffer many things and be rejected from this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot: They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even in the same way will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods are in the house, let him not come down to take them away. And likewise the one who is in the field, let him not return back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember LotÂ’s wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed: the one will be taken and the other will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two will be grinding together: the one will be taken and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Two will be in the field: the one will be taken and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they answered and said to Him, Where, Lord? And He said to them, Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
