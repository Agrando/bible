And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him according to the custom of the Law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lord, now You are letting Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for my eyes have seen Your Salvation</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>a Light to bring revelation to the Gentiles, and the Glory of Your people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Joseph and His mother marveled at the things which were spoken concerning Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother, Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>(yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there was one, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and she was a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And coming in that instant she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke concerning Him to all those in Jerusalem who looked for redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So when they had performed all things according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when they had finished the days, as they returned, the boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>but supposing Him to have been in the company, they went a days journey, and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And so it was that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, Son, why have You done this to us? Behold, Your father and I have sought You, greatly distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And He said to them, Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I need to be in the things of My Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them; but His mother kept all these words in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
