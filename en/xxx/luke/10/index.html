Do not go from house to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And heal the sick there, and say to them, The kingdom of God has come near to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The very dust of your city which clings to us we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I say to you that it will be more tolerable in that Day for Sodom than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to the heavens, will be thrust down to Hades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who hears you hears Me, he who rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And He said to them, I saw Satan fall like lightning from Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, I give you authority to tread over serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, I praise You, Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to babes. Even so, Father, for so it was pleasing in Your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then He turned to His disciples and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things you see;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not seen it, and to hear what you hear, and have not heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said to him, What is written in the Law? How do you read it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So he answered and said, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And He said to him, You have answered rightly; do this and you will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Jesus answered and said: A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, who stripped him of his clothing, wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now by chance a certain priest came down that road. And when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And likewise a Levite, when he arrived at the place, came and looked, and passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was. And when he saw him, he had compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So he went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And on the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I come back, I will repay you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So which of these three do you suppose was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he said, He who showed mercy on him. Then Jesus said to him, Go and you do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha received Him into her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at JesusÂ’ feet and heard His Word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came to Him and said, Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
