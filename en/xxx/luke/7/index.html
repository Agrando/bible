And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well; the one who had been sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened the next day, that He went into a city called Nain; and many of His disciples went with Him, as well as a large crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when He came near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, Do not weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He came and touched the coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, Arise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He presented him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And fear came upon all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has risen up among us; and, God has visited His people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this report about Him went throughout all Judea and all the surrounding region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And John, calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to Jesus, saying, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When the men had come to Him, they said, John the Immerser has sent us to You, saying, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in the same hour He cured many of diseases, plagues, and evil spirits; and to many who were blind He gave sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard: that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And blessed is he who is not made to stumble because of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold, those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are in kings courts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For I say to you, Among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Immerser. But he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when all the people heard Him, even the tax collectors justified God, having been immersed with the immersion of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been immersed by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and what are they like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, saying: We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned to you, and you did not weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For John the Immerser came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a glutton and a wino, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But wisdom is justified from all her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to the Pharisees house, and sat down to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisees house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and stood at His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. So he said, Teacher, speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Simon answered and said, I suppose the one whom he forgave more. And He said to him, You have rightly judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them away with the hair of her head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
