Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>saying, The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they remembered His words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of Jacob, and the other women with them, who told these things to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And their words seemed to them like idle nonsense, and they did not believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying by themselves; and he departed, wondering to himself at what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was seven miles from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So it was, while they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But their eyes were held, so that they did not recognize Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He said to them, What kind of conversation is this that you have with one another as you walk and are sad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the one whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, Are You only a stranger in Jerusalem, and do not know the things which happened there in these days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And He said to them, What things? So they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yes, and certain women of our company, who arrived at the tomb early, astonished us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He is alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then He said to them, O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they drew near to the village where they were going, and He made as though He would have gone farther.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And He went in to stay with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, as He sat at the table with them, that He took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And their eyes were opened and they knew Him; and He vanished from their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they said to one another, Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us on the road, and while He opened the Scriptures to us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>saying, The Lord truly is risen, and has appeared to Simon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they told about the things that had happened on the road, and how He was known to them in the breaking of bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they were saying these things, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, Peace to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed they were seeing a ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And He said to them, Why are you troubled? And why do reasonings arise in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled, He said to them, Have you any food here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And He took it and ate in their presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then He said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And He said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and that repentance and remission of sins be preached in His name to all nations, beginning out of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And you are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but stay in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and carried up into Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And they did homage to Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
