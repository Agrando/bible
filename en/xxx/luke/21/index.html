And what sign will there be when these things are about to take place?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And He said: Take heed that you not be led astray. For many will come in My name, saying, I AM, and, The time is here. Therefore do not go after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified; for these things must come to pass first, but the end is not immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then He said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there will be great earthquakes from place to place, and famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and rulers on account of My name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But it will turn to you for testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore settle it in your hearts not to premeditate a defense;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to contradict or resist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you will be hated by all because of My name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But not a hair of your head shall at all perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By your steadfastness possess your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those who are in the midst of her depart, and let not those who are in the country enter her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there will be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>menÂ’s hearts failing them from fear and the expectation of the things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then He spoke to them a parable: Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When they are already budding, you see and know for yourselves that summer is now near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So you also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Truly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all things take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with giddiness, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that Day come upon you unexpectedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For it will come as a snare on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Watch therefore, and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And in the daytime He was teaching in the temple, but at night He went out and stayed on the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple to hear Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
