Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Give us day by day our bread sufficient for the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>for a friend of mine has come to me on his journey, and I have nothing to set before him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he will answer from within and say, Do not trouble me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say to you, Though he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him as much as he needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So I say to you, Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If a son asks for bread from any father among you, he will not give him a stone, will he? Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a serpent instead of a fish, will he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Or if he asks for an egg, he will not give him a scorpion, will he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. So it was, when the demon had gone out, that the mute spoke; and the multitudes marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But some of them said, He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Others, testing Him, sought from Him a sign from Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? Because you say I cast out demons by Beelzebub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I cast out demons with the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are at peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when one stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes from him all his armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When an unclean spirit goes out from a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, I will return to my house from which I came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he comes, he finds it swept and put in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it happened, as He spoke these things, that a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, Blessed is the womb that bore You, and the breasts which You sucked!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But He said, No; rather, blessed are those who hear the Word of God and keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And while the crowds were thickly gathered together, He began to say, This is an evil generation. It seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a secret place or under a basket, but on a lampstand, that those who come in may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore, when your eye is sound, your whole body also is full of light. But when your eye is evil, your body also is full of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore take heed that the light which is in you is not darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If then your whole body is full of light, having no dark part, all will be full of light, as when the shining of a lamp gives you light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as He spoke, a certain Pharisee asked Him to dine with him. So He went in and sat down to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that He had not first washed before dinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and dish clean, but your inward part is full of robbery and wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Foolish ones! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But rather give alms from what is within; and behold, all things are clean to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and all kinds of herbs, and pass by justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without neglecting those.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like graves which are not seen, and the men who walk over them are not aware of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then one of the lawyers answered and said to Him, Teacher, by saying these things You also insult us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And He said, Woe to you also, lawyers! For you load men with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Therefore, you bear witness that you approve of the deeds of your fathers; for they indeed killed them, and you build their tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Therefore also the wisdom of God said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required from this generation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the temple. Yes, I say to you, it shall be required from this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And as He said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to quarrel with Him forcefully, and to cross-examine Him about many things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>lying in wait for Him, and seeking to catch Him in something He might say, in order to accuse Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
