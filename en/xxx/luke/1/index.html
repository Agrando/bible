His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So it was, that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot fell to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the angel said to him, Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mothers womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He will also go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Zacharias said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel answered and said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and was sent to speak to you and bring you these glad tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But behold, you will be mute and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people waited for Zacharias, and wondered that he lingered so long in the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he made signs to them and remained speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And so it was, as soon as the days of his service were fulfilled, that he departed to his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus the Lord has done with me, in the days when He looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgins name was Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And having come in, the angel said to her, Hail, favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and contemplated what kind of greeting this might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name JESUS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Mary said to the angel, How can this be, since I do not know a man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now behold, Elizabeth your kinswoman has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For not one declaration of God will be impossible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it happened, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And she spoke out with a loud voice and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And why is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For indeed, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Blessed is she who believes, for there will be a fulfillment of those things which were told her from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For He regards the lowly state of His handmaid; for behold, henceforth all generations will count me blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For He who is mighty does great things to me, and holy is His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And His mercy is on those who fear Him from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He performs mightily with His arm; He scatters the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He puts down the mighty from their thrones, and exalts the lowly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He fills the hungry with good things, and the rich He sends away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now Elizabeths time was fulfilled for her to be delivered, and she brought forth a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>So it was, on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they were calling him by the name of his father, Zacharias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But they said to her, There is no one among your kindred who is called by this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>So they made signs to his father; what he would have him called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. So they all marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And fear came on all who dwelt around them; and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And all those who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What kind of child will this be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>and raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets since the world began,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Deliverance from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>to perform mercy with our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>the oath which He swore to our father Abraham:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>To grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>through the tender mercy of our God, with which the Dayspring from on high has visited us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>to give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>So the child grew and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his proclamation to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
