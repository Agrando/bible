So he divided to them his livelihood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when he had spent all, there arose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be destitute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the husks that the swine ate, and no one gave to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my fatherÂ’s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his servants, Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, Your brother has come, and because he has received him safe and sound, your father has killed the fatted calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and begged him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It was right that we should make merry and rejoice, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
