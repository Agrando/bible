Cut it down; why does it encumber the ground?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he answered and said to him, Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And see if it produces fruit. But if not, after that you can cut it down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bent over and could in no way raise herself up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Jesus saw her, He called her to Him and said to her, Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He laid hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath; and he said to the crowd, There are six days in which men ought to work; therefore come and be healed in them, and not on the Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Lord then answered him and said, Hypocrite! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or donkey from the stall, and lead it away to water it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, lo, eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then He said, What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and threw in his garden; and it grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again He said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And He went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then one said to Him, Lord, are there few who are saved? And He said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not be able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When once the Master of the house has risen up and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us, and He will answer and say to you, I do not know you, where you are from,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then you will begin to say, We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But He will say, I tell you I do not know you, where you are from. Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrust outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they will come from the east and the west, from the north and the south, and sit down in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And indeed there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>On that same day certain Pharisees came, saying to Him, Get out and depart from here, for Herod wants to kill You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And He said to them, Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I am being perfected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless I must journey today, tomorrow, and the day following; for it cannot be allowed to happen for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her, how often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you were not willing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Behold, your house is left to you desolate! And truly, I say to you, You shall not see Me until the time comes when you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
