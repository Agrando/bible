Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But you are those who have continued with Me in My trials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I appoint a kingdom to you, as My Father appointed unto Me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon. Behold, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I have prayed for you, that your faith does not fail; and when you have returned, strengthen your brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then He said, I tell you, Peter, the rooster shall not crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And He said to them, When I sent you without money bag, knapsack, and sandals, did you lack anything? And they said, Nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then He said to them, But now, he who has a money bag, let him take it, and likewise a knapsack; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I say to you that this which is written must still be accomplished in Me: And He was numbered with the transgressors. For the things concerning Me have an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And coming out, He went to the Mount of Olives, as He was accustomed, and His disciples also followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when He came to the place, He said to them, Pray that you do not enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And He was withdrawn from them about a stones throw, and He knelt down and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, Father, if You are willing, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then an angel appeared to Him from Heaven, strengthening Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. And His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when He rose up from prayer, and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And He said to them, Why do you sleep? Rise and pray, that you do not enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while He was still speaking, behold, a multitude; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But Jesus said to him, Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>When those around Him saw what was about to happen, they said to Him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But Jesus answered and said, Permit even this. And He touched his ear and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, commanders of the temple, and the elders who had come to Him, Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against Me. But this is your hour, and the authority of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And having arrested Him, they led Him away and brought Him into the high priests house. And Peter followed at a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And a certain servant girl, seeing him as he sat by the fire, looked intently at him and said, This man was also with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied Him, saying, Woman, I do not know Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a little while another saw him and said, You also are of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then after about an hour had passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, Truly this fellow also was with Him, for he is a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are saying. Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Peter went out and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Now the men who held Jesus mocked Him and beat Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And having blindfolded Him, they struck Him on the face and asked Him, saying, Prophesy! Who is the one who struck You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, came together and led Him into their council, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>If You are the Christ, tell us. But He said to them, If I tell you, you will by no means believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And if I also ask you, you will by no means answer Me or let Me go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Hereafter the Son of Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Then they all said, Are You then the Son of God? And He said to them, You affirm that I AM.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And they said, What further testimony do we need? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
