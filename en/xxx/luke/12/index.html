And not one of them is forgotten before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also I say to you, whoever confesses Me before men, the Son of Man will also confess him before the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now when they bring you to the synagogues and rulers and authorities, do not worry about how or what you should answer, or what you should say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then one from the crowd said to Him, Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But He said to him, Man, who made Me a judge or a divider over you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He said to them, Take heed and beware of covetousness, for ones life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then He spoke a parable to them, saying: The ground of a certain rich man yielded plentifully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, since I have nowhere to gather my fruits?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So he said, I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger, and there I will gather all my fruits and my goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; take your ease; eat, drink, and be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But God said to him, Fool! This night your soul will be required of you; then whose will those things be which you have prepared?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And He said to His disciples, Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat; nor about the body, what you will put on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap, which have neither storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them. By how much do you surpass birds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And which of you by being anxious is able to add one cubit to his stature?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If you then are not able to do even the least, why are you anxious about the rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; and yet I say to you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If then God so clothes the grass, which today is in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more you, you of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And do not seek what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor be agitated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For all these things the nations of the world seek after, and your Father knows that you need these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things will be conveyed to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Do not fear, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sell what you have and give alms; provide yourselves money bags which do not grow old, a treasure in Heaven that does not fail, where a thief does not come near nor moth destroys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and you yourselves be like men who wait for their master, when he will return from the wedding, that when he comes and knocks they may open to him immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he comes, will find watching. Truly, I say to you that he will gird himself and have them sit down to eat, and will come and serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if he should come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be dug through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Peter said to Him, Lord, do You speak this parable only to us, or to everyone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his master will set over his servants, to give them their portion of food at the right time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Truly, I say to you that he will set him over all that he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But if that servant says in his heart, My master is delaying his coming, and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and be drunk,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not expecting him, and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him apart and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that servant who knew his masters will, and did not prepare himself or do according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been committed, of him they will ask the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I came to throw fire on the earth, and what will I if it is already kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I have an immersion to be immersed with, and how distressed I am till it is accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Do you suppose that I came to give peace on earth? I tell you, not at all, but rather division.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For from now on five in one house will be divided: three against two, and two against three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Father will be divided against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then He also said to the multitudes, Whenever you see a cloud rising out of the west, immediately you say, A thunder storm is coming; and so it happens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when you see the south wind blow, you say, There will be heat; and it comes to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Hypocrites! You can discern the face of the sky and of the earth, but how is it you do not discern this time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Yes, and why, even of yourselves, do you not judge what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>When you go with your adversary to the ruler, make every effort along the way to settle with him, lest he drag you to the judge, the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>I tell you, you shall by no means depart from there till you have paid the very last mite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
