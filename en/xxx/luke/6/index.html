And His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate them, rubbing them in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And some of the Pharisees said to them, Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Jesus answering them said, Have you never read this, what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>how he went into the house of God, took and ate the Bread of Presentation, and also gave some to those with him, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He said to them, The Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it also happened on another Sabbath, that He entered the synagogue and taught. And a man was there whose right hand was withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So the scribes and Pharisees watched Him closely, whether He would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, Arise and stand in the middle. And he arose and stood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jesus said to them, I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when He had looked around at them all, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he did so, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But they were filled with madness, and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now it came to pass in those days that He went out into the mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when it was day, He called His disciples; and from them He chose twelve whom He also named apostles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; Jacob and John; Philip and Bartholomew;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Matthew and Thomas; Jacob the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Judas of Jacob, and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He came down with them and stood on a level place with a crowd of His disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him and be healed from their diseases,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>as well as those who were tormented by unclean spirits. And they were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the whole multitude sought to touch Him, for power went out from Him and healed everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And He lifted up His eyes toward His disciples, and said: Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude you, and revile you, and cast out your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice in that day and leap for joy. For behold, your reward is great in Heaven, for in the same way their fathers did to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you who are full, for you shall hunger. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers did the same things to the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>bless those who curse you, and pray for those who treat you abusively.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also. And from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to everyone who asks of you. And from him who takes away your goods do not ask for them back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as you would have men do to you, you also do likewise to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For if you love those who love you, what thanks is there to you? For even sinners love those who love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks is there to you? For even sinners do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks is there to you? For even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For He is kind to the unthankful and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over it will be put into your bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And He spoke a parable to them: Is the blind able to lead the blind? Will they not both fall into the ditch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who has been fitted out will be like his teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And why do you look at the twig in your brothers eye, but do not perceive the beam in your own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me remove the twig that is in your eye, when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the twig that is in your brothers eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For a good tree does not produce bad fruit, nor does a bad tree produce good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For every tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But why do you call Me Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Everyone who comes to Me, and hears My sayings and does them, I will show you whom he is like:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He is like a man building a house, who digs deep and lays the foundation on the rock. And when the flood rises, the stream bursts against that house, and cannot shake it, for it is founded on the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he who hears and does not act is like a man who builds a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream bursts; and immediately it falls. And the ruin of that house is great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
