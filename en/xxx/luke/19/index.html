You take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to him, Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a harsh man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him, and give it to him who has ten minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But they said to him, Master, he has ten minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For I say to you, that to everyone who has will be given; and from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, and slay them before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When He had said this, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, when He came near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mountain called Olivet, that He sent two of His disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, Go into the village opposite you, where as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Loose it and bring it here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if anyone asks you, Why are you loosing it? you shall say to him, Because the Lord has need of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So those who were sent went their way and found it just as He had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, Why are you loosing the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, The Lord has need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then they led it to Jesus. And they threw their clothes on the colt, and they set Jesus on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as He went, they spread their clothes on the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as He was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>saying: Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in Heaven and glory in the highest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees called to Him from the crowd, Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But He answered and said to them, I tell you that if these should keep silent, the stones would immediately cry out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And as He drew near, He saw the city and wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, If you had known, even you, at least in this your day, the things that make for your peace. But now they are hidden from your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, surround you and besiege you on every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and tear you down, and your children within you, to the ground; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not know the time of your visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And He went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying to them, It is written, My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And He was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests, the scribes, and the chief of the people sought to destroy Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and were unable to figure out anything to do; for all the people hung on to hear Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
