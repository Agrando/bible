Or who is he who gave You this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But He answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, and answer Me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The immersion of John; was it from Heaven or from men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From Heaven, He will say, Why then did you not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So they answered that they did not know where it was from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then He began to tell the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard, leased it to vinedressers, and went into a far country for a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now at the right time he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vinedressers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And again he sent another servant; and they beat him also, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him when they see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may become ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come and destroy these vinedressers and give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it they said, Let it not be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He looked at them and said, What then is this that is written: The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whoever falls on that stone will be broken in pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will crush him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the chief priests and the scribes that same hour sought to lay hands on Him, but they feared the people; for they knew He had spoken this parable against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So they watched Him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might seize on one of His words, in order to deliver Him to the power and the authority of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they asked Him, saying, Teacher, we know that You say and teach rightly, and You do not show personal regard, but teach the way of God in truth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But He perceived their craftiness, and said to them, Why do you test Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered and said, Caesars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And He said to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they could not catch Him in His words in the presence of the people. And they marveled at His answer and kept silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, came to Him and asked Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying: Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a mans brother dies, having a wife, and he dies without children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and died without children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the second took her as wife, and he died childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven also; and they left no children, and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife is she? For the seven had her as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But those who are counted worthy to attain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>nor is it possible for them to die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But even Moses showed at the bush that the dead are raised, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For He is not the God of the dead but of the living, for all live to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then some of the scribes answered and said, Teacher, You have well said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And after that they dared not question Him anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And He said to them, How do they say that the Christ is the Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Now David himself said in the Book of Psalms: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>till I make Your enemies Your footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Therefore David calls Him Lord; how is He then his Son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then, in the hearing of all the people, He said to His disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces, the chief seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at feasts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>who devour widows houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
