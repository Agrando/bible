And He took him and healed him, and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He answered them, saying, Which of you, having a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they were not able to contradict Him regarding these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose the best places, saying to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in the best place, lest one more honorable than you be invited by him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he who invited you and him come and say to you, Give place to this man, and then you begin with shame to take the lowest place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes he may say to you, Friend, go up higher. Then you will have glory in the presence of those who sit at the table with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then He also said to him who invited Him, When you give a dinner or a supper, do not invite your friends, your brothers, your relatives, nor rich neighbors, lest they also invite you back, and you be repaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you will be blessed, because they do not have the means to repay you; for you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now when one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then He said to him, A certain man gave a great supper and invited many,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited, Come, for all things are now ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But they all with one accord began to decline. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must go and see it. I ask you to have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I ask you to have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So that servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and the maimed and the lame and the blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the servant said, Master, it is done as you commanded, and still there is room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the master said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I say to you that none of those men who had been invited shall taste of my supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And great multitudes went with Him. And He turned and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, and wife and children, and brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>lest, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, This man began to build and was not able to finish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks terms of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So likewise, whoever of you does not bid farewell to all that he has is not able to be My disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its flavor, how shall it be seasoned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill, but men throw it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
