To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully assured in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who regards the day, regards it to the Lord; and he who does not regard the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord over both the dead and the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you treat your brother as being of no account? For everyone shall appear before the judgment seat of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written: As I live, says the Lord, Every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then each of us shall give account concerning himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this, not to put a stumbling block or a snare in our brothers way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself; but to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yet if your brother is grieved because of your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore do not let your good be spoken of as evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore let us pursue the things of peace and the things that build up one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not bring to naught the work of God on account of food. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for the man whose eating causes a stumbling block.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is good not to eat flesh nor drink wine nor do anything by which your brother stumbles or is enticed to sin or is made weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Blessed is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not out of faith; for whatever is not out of faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
