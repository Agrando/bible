Will their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let it not be! Indeed, let God be true but every man a liar. As it is written: That You may be found just in Your words, and may win the case when You are judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust who lays on wrath? (I speak as a man.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let it not be! Otherwise, how will God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if in my lie, the truth of God has abounded to His glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And why not say (as we are slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil that good may come? Their condemnation is just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? Do we surpass them? Not at all. For we have previously charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>there is none who understands; there is none who seeks after God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They have all turned aside; they have together become unprofitable; there is none who does good, no, not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throat is an open tomb; with their tongues they have practiced deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their feet are swift to shed blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>destruction and misery are in their ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the way of peace they have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know that whatever the Law says, it says to those who are under the Law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore by the deeds of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for through the Law is the full true knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now the righteousness of God apart from the Law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>even the righteousness of God, through the faith of Jesus Christ, to all and upon all who believe. For there is no difference;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, to give evidence of His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>to prove at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who is of the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but through the law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>since there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we then annul the Law through faith? Let it not be! No rather, we establish the Law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
