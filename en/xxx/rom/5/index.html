For if by the one mans offense many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the gift is not like it was through the one who sinned. For the judgment from one offense was unto condemnation, but the free gift from many offenses is unto justification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if by the one mans offense death reigned through the one, much more those who are receiving abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore, as through one mans offense judgment was to every person unto condemnation, even so through one Mans righteous act the free gift is to every person unto justification of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For as through one mans disobedience many were declared sinners, so also through one Mans obedience many will be declared righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreover the Law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
