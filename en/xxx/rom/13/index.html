For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are ordained by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will receive judgment on themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For he is Gods minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is Gods minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are Gods ministers attending continually to this very thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not covet; and if there is any other commandment, all are summed up in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love does no evil to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And do this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us walk decently, as in the day, not in carousings and drunkenness, not in cohabitation and licentiousness, not in strife and envy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
