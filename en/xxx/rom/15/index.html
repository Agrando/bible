Praise Him, all you peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again, Isaiah says: There shall be a root of Jesse; and He who shall rise to reign over the Gentiles, in Him the Gentiles shall hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now I myself am confident concerning you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nevertheless, brethren, I have written more boldly to you on some points, as reminding you, because of the grace given to me by God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>that I might be a minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore I have reason to exult in Christ Jesus in the things which pertain to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I will not dare to speak of anything which Christ has not accomplished through me, unto the obedience of the Gentiles in word and deed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum I have fulfilled the preaching of the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And so I have striven to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, so that I should not build on another manÂ’s foundation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but as it is written: To whom He was not announced, they shall see; and those who have not heard shall understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For this reason I also have been much hindered from coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now no longer having a place in these regions, and having a great desire these many years to come to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whenever I may journey to Spain, I shall come to you; for I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may be filled with your company briefly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For it pleased those from Macedonia and Achaia to make certain gifts for the poor among the saints who are in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it seemed good to them, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been partakers of their spiritual things, it is also their duty to minister to them in carnal things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, when I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit, I shall go through you to Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now I exhort you, brethren, through the Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in prayers to God on my behalf,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be delivered from those in Judea who are disobedient, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>that I may come to you with joy through the will of God, and may be refreshed together with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
