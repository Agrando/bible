Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive through His Spirit who dwells in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors; not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you did not receive a spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, Abba, Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and if children, then heirs; heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed unto us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creation was subjected to vanity, not willingly, but through Him who subjected it in hope;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that the whole creation groans and travails together until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Not only that, but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For we were saved by hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who shall bring a charge against GodÂ’s elect? It is God who justifies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, but rather is also raised, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As it is written: For Your sake we are killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yet in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loves us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers nor powers, nor things present nor things to come,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
