Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let it not be! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Or do you not know that as many of us as were immersed into Christ Jesus were immersed into His death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore we were buried with Him through immersion into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in resurrection,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be nullified, that we should no longer serve sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For he who has died has been justified from sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under Law but under grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under Law but under grace? Let it not be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that oneÂ’s slaves whom you obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But God be thanked that though you were slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And having been set free from sin, you became slaves to righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness, and to iniquity unto iniquity, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For when you were slaves to sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
