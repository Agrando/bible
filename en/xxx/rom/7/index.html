But if the husband dies, she is released from the law of her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So then if, while her husband lives, she becomes another mans, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she becomes another mans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the Law through the body of Christ, that you may become Anothers; to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sin which were through the Law were at work in our members to bear fruit unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now we have been loosed from the Law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? Let it not be! On the contrary, I would not have understood sin except through the Law. For I would not have known lust unless the Law had said, You shall not covet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, produced in me every lust. For apart from the Law sin is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I was alive once apart from the Law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the commandment, which was unto life, I found to be unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore the Law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Has then that which is good become death to me? Let it not be! But sin, that it might appear to be sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For what I am doing, I do not understand. For what I do not wish to do, that I do; moreover, what I hate, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If, then, I do what I do not wish to do, I agree with the Law that it is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But now, it is no longer I doing it, but sin that dwells in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to desire is present with me, but how to perform what is good I do not find.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the good that I wish to do, I do not do; but the evil I do not wish to do, that I practice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now if I do what I do not wish to do, it is no longer I doing it, but sin that dwells in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one desiring to do good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I delight in the Law of God according to the inward man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I thank God; through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with the mind I myself serve the Law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
