(that is, to bring Christ down)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>or, Who will descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what does it say? The Word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart (that is, the Word of Faith which we preach):</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the Scripture says, Everyone believing on Him will not be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich toward all who call upon Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For everyone, whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How then shall they call on Him into whom they do not believe? And how shall they believe Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without preaching?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how shall they preach if they are not sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those preaching the gospel of peace, bringing glad tidings of good things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they have not all obeyed the gospel, for Isaiah says, Lord, who believes our report?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So then faith is of hearing, and hearing through the Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I say, have they not heard? Yes indeed: Their sound has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I say, did Israel not know? First Moses says: I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation, I will move you to anger by a foolish nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Isaiah is very bold and says: I was found by those who did not seek Me; I was made manifest to those not inquiring after Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But to Israel he says: All day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and contradicting people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
