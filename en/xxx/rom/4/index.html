Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now to him who works, the wages are not counted according to grace but according to debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted unto righteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God accounts righteousness apart from works:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall not account sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Does this blessedness then come upon the circumcised only, or upon the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How then was it accounted? While he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those believing through uncircumcision, that righteousness might be accounted to them also;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham while still uncircumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the promise that he would be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise has been annulled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>because the Law brings about wrath; for where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(as it is written, I have made you a father of many nations) in the presence of Him whom he believed; God, who makes the dead alive and calls those things which do not exist as though they did;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who, against hope, believed in hope, so that he might become the father of many nations, according to what was spoken, So shall your seed be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead (since he was about a hundred years old), and the deadness of SarahÂ’s womb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>he did not hesitate at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and being fully assured that what He had promised He is also able to perform.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And therefore it was accounted to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was accounted to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but also for us, to whom it shall be accounted, believing in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who was delivered up because of our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
