Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this reason God gives them up to vile passions. For even their women change the natural use for what is contrary to nature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Likewise also the men, abandoning the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men with men performing what is shameful, and receiving the retribution within themselves, the penalty which is fitting for their error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And even as they do not like to have God in their full true knowledge, God gives them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>being filled with every unrighteousness, sexual perversion, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, depravity; whisperers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>defamers, haters of God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>without understanding, untrustworthy, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do them, but also approve of those who practice them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
