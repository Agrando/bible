Let it not be! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But what does the Divine response say to him? I have reserved to Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even so then, at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace no longer becomes grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? Israel has not obtained what it seeks; but the elect have obtained it, and the rest were hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Just as it is written: God has given them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David says: Let their table become a snare and a trap, and a stumbling block and a recompense to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see, and bow down their back always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say then, have they stumbled that they should come to an end? Let it not be! But through their trespass, to provoke them to jealousy, salvation has come to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if their trespass is riches for the world; and their diminishing, riches for the Gentiles; how much more their fullness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh and save some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if their being cast away is the reconciling of the world, what will their reception be but life from the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the firstfruit is holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them became a partaker of the root and fatness of the olive tree,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say then, The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Well, because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be highminded, but fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For if God did not spare the natural branches, He may not spare you either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: On those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, who are natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, that you not be wise within yourselves, that hardness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: The Deliverer will come out of Zion, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Indeed, concerning the gospel they are enemies because of you, but concerning the election they are beloved because of the fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the gifts and the calling of God are without regret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For as you were once disobedient to God, yet have now obtained mercy through their disobedience,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>even so these also have now been disobedient, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God has enclosed everyone in disobedience, that He might have mercy on each one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has become His counselor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Or who has first given to Him and it shall be repaid to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things, to whom be glory forever. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
