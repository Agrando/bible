You shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Nor shall you make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to their son, nor take their daughter for your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For they will turn your sons away from following Me, to serve other gods; and the anger of Jehovah will burn against you and quickly destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But thus you shall deal with them: you shall break down their altars, and shatter their pillars, and chop down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For you are a holy people unto Jehovah your God; Jehovah your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure out of all the peoples upon the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jehovah did not set His love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people, for you were the least of all peoples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but because Jehovah loves you, and to keep the oath which He has sworn to your fathers, Jehovah has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore know that Jehovah your God, He is God, the faithful Mighty God who keeps covenant and mercy for a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and He repays those who hate Him, to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack with him who hates Him; He will repay him to his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore you shall keep the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which I am commanding you today, to do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then it shall come to pass, because you obey these judgments, and keep and do them, that Jehovah your God will keep with you the covenant and the mercy which He has sworn to your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He will love you and bless you and multiply you; He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the offspring of your cattle and the increase of your flock, in the land of which He has sworn to your fathers to give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall be blessed above all peoples; there shall not be sterility or barrenness among you or among your livestock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jehovah will take away from you all sickness, and will afflict you with none of the terrible diseases of Egypt which you have known, but will lay them on all those who hate you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you shall destroy all the peoples whom Jehovah your God is delivering over to you; your eye shall have no pity on them; nor shall you serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you should think in your heart, These nations are greater than I; how can I dispossess them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>you shall not be afraid of them, but you shall call to mind to remember what Jehovah your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the great trials which your eyes have seen, the signs and the wonders, the mighty hand and the outstretched arm, by which Jehovah your God has brought you out. Thus shall Jehovah your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreover Jehovah your God will send the hornet among them, for those who are left, who hide themselves from your face, to perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You shall not be terrified of them; for Jehovah your God, the great and awesome Mighty God, is among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehovah your God will clear away those nations before you little by little; you shall not prevail to destroy them all at once, lest the beasts of the field become too numerous for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Jehovah your God will deliver them over to you, and will defeat them with great confusion to annihilate them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall destroy their name from under the heavens; no one shall be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You shall burn the graven images of their gods with fire; you shall not covet the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it for yourselves, lest you be snared by it; for it is an abomination to Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nor shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be utterly destroyed like it. You shall detest it unto abomination and loathe it unto abhorrence, for it is a prohibited thing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
