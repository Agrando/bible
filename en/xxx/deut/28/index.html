you shall not prosper in your ways; you shall be only oppressed and plundered all your days, and no one shall deliver you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>You shall betroth a wife, but another man shall lie with her; you shall build a house, but you shall not dwell in it; you shall plant a vineyard, but shall not begin to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes, but you shall not eat of it; your donkey shall be violently taken away from before you, and shall not be restored to you; your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall have no one to rescue them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, and your eyes shall look and fail with longing for them all day long;

for the worms shall eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You shall have olive trees throughout all your territory, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olives shall drop off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You shall beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Locusts shall dispossess all your trees and the produce of your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The sojourners among you shall rise higher and higher above you, and you shall come down lower and lower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He shall lend to you, but you shall not lend to him; he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Moreover all these curses shall come upon you and pursue and overtake you, until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the voice of Jehovah your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He has commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they shall be upon you for a sign and a wonder, and upon your seed perpetually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Because you did not serve Jehovah your God with joy and gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>therefore you shall serve your enemies, whom Jehovah will send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in need of everything; and He will put a yoke of iron upon your neck until He has destroyed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jehovah will bring a nation against you from afar, from the ends of the earth, as the eagle flies, a nation whose language you will not understand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>a nation of fierce countenance, which does not regard the face of the old nor show favor to the young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And they shall eat the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your land, until you are destroyed; they shall not leave you grain or new wine or oil, or the offspring of your cattle or the increase of your flocks, until they have destroyed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They shall besiege you at all your gates until your high and fortified walls, in which you trust, come down throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you at all your gates throughout all your land which Jehovah your God has given to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>You shall eat the fruit of your own womb, the flesh of your sons and your daughters whom Jehovah your God has given to you, in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemies shall distress you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The eye of the man who is tender and very delicate shall quiver with hostility toward his brother, toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the rest of his children whom he leaves behind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>so that he will not give to any of them the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he has nothing left in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The eye of the tender and dainty woman among you, who would not have ventured to set the sole of her foot on the ground because of her delicateness and tenderness, will quiver with hostility toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son and her daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>and toward her afterbirth which comes forth from between her feet and her children whom she bears; for she shall eat them secretly for lack of everything in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>If you do not take heed to do all the Words of this Law that are written in this book, to fear this glorious and awesome name, JEHOVAH GOD,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>then Jehovah will bring upon you and your seed extraordinary plagues; great and long lasting plagues; and evil long lasting sicknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Moreover He will bring back upon you all the diseases of Egypt, of which you were afraid, and they shall cleave to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Also every sickness and every plague, which is not written in this Book of the Law, will Jehovah bring upon you to destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of heaven in multitude, because you would not obey the voice of Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And it shall be, that just as Jehovah has rejoiced over you to do you good and multiply you, so Jehovah will rejoice over you to destroy you and annihilate you; and you shall be torn away from off the land which you are going in to possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And Jehovah will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other, and there you shall serve other gods, which neither you nor your fathers have known; wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And among those nations you shall find no rest, nor shall the sole of your foot have a resting place; but there Jehovah shall give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and fainting soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Your life shall hang in doubt before you; you shall fear day and night, and have no assurance of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>In the morning you shall say, Oh, that it were evening! And at evening you shall say, Oh, that it were morning! because of the fear which terrifies your heart, and because of the sight which your eyes see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And Jehovah will take you back to Egypt in ships, by the way of which I had said to you, You shall never see it again. And there you shall have been sold to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
