Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn out on your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink, that you may know that I am Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when you came to this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us to battle, and we struck them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore keep the Words of this covenant, and do them, that you may be wise in all that you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All of you are standing today before Jehovah your God: your heads, your tribes, your elders and your officials, all the men of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>your little ones and your wives; and the sojourner who is in your camp, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>to enter into the covenant with Jehovah your God, and into His oath, which Jehovah your God is making with you today,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>to establish you today as a people for Himself, to be, Himself, your God, just as He has spoken to you, and as He has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am making this covenant and this oath, not only with you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but with him who stands here with us today before Jehovah our God, as well as with him who is not here with us today</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(for you know that we dwelt in the land of Egypt and that we came through the nations which you passed by,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and you saw their abominations and their idols among them of wood and stone and silver and gold);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>so that there not be among you man or woman or family or tribe, whose heart turns away today from Jehovah our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations, and that there not be among you a root bearing venom or bitterness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and so it not happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he has blessed himself in his heart, thinking, I shall have peace, even though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart; and thus to snatch away the watered with the thirsty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jehovah will not consent to forgive him; for then the anger of Jehovah and His jealousy shall smoke against that man, and every curse that is written in this book shall lie down upon him, and Jehovah shall blot out his name from under the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah shall separate him from all the tribes of Israel for evil, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the Law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>so that your children of the generations to come, who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which Jehovah has laid upon it, shall utter:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The whole land is brimstone, salt, and burning; it is not sown, nor does it sprout, nor does any grass grow there, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which Jehovah overthrew in His anger and His wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the nations shall say, Why has Jehovah done thus unto this land? What is the meaning of this great burning anger?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then people shall say: Because they have forsaken the covenant of Jehovah the God of their fathers, which He had made with them to bring them out of the land of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for they went and served other gods and bowed down to them, gods that they had not known and that He had not apportioned to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the anger of Jehovah burned against this land, to bring upon it every curse that is written in this Book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jehovah uprooted them from their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jehovah our God hides Himself; but reveals Himself to us and to our children forever, to do all the Words of this Law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
