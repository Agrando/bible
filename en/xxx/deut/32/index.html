Is He not your Father, who bought you? Has He not made you and established you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will say to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the Most High divided their inheritance to the nations, when He separated the sons of Adam, He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For JehovahÂ’s portion is His people; Jacob is the allotment of His inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He found him in a desert land and in the wasteland, a howling wilderness; He encircled him, He instructed him, He kept him as the pupil of His eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As an eagle stirs up its nest, hovers over its young, spreading out its wings, taking them up, carrying them on its wings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so Jehovah alone led him, and there was no foreign god with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He made him ride in the heights of the earth, that he might eat the produce of the fields; He made him suck honey from the rock, and oil from the rock of flint;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>butter from the cattle, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs; and rams of the sons of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of wheat; and you drank wine, the blood of the grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; you grew fat, you grew thick, you are gorged! And he forsook the God who had made him, and treated with contempt the Rock of his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They provoked Him to jealousy with strange gods; with abominations they provoked Him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They sacrificed to demons, not to God, to gods they had not known, to new gods come lately, that your fathers had not feared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of the Rock who begot you, you are unmindful, and have forgotten the Mighty God who brought you forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when Jehovah saw it, He spurned them, because of the provocation of His sons and His daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And He said, I will hide My face from them, I will see what their end will be, for they are a perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They have provoked Me to jealousy by what is not the Mighty God; they have moved Me to anger by their vanities. So I will provoke them to jealousy by those who are not a people; I will move them to anger by a foolish nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For a fire has been kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest Sheol; it shall consume the earth with her produce, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will heap evil upon them; I will use up My arrows upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They shall be wasted with hunger, devoured by burning heat and bitter destruction; I will also send against them the teeth of beasts, with the poison of the serpents of the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The sword from outside, and the terror from within, shall bereave the young man and virgin, the nursing child and the man of gray hairs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have said, I will dash them in pieces, I will bring to an end the memory of them from among men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>had I not feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should misunderstand, lest they should say, our hand is high; and Jehovah has not done all this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For they are a nation void of counsel, nor is there any understanding in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Oh, that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and Jehovah had delivered them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For their rock is not like our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Their wine is the poison of serpents, and the cruel venom of vipers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Is this not laid up in store with Me, sealed up among My treasures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Vengeance is Mine, and recompense; their foot shall slip in due time; for the day of their calamity is near, and the things prepared have made haste upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For Jehovah will judge His people and have compassion on His servants, when He sees that their power is gone, and there is no one remaining, bond or free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He will say, Where are their gods, the rock in which they sought refuge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you, and be your refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See now that I, even I, am He, and there is no God besides Me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; nor is there any who can deliver out of My hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For I raise My hand to the heavens, and say, As I live forever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>if I whet My glittering sword, and My hand takes hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to My enemies, and repay those who hate Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I will make My arrows drunk with blood, and My sword shall devour flesh, with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the heads of the commanders of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Rejoice, O nations, with His people; for He will avenge the blood of His servants, and render vengeance to His adversaries; He will provide atonement for His land and His people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Moses came with Joshua the son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and He said to them: Set your hearts on all the words which I am testifying against you today, that you command your children to take heed to do all the Words of this Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For these are not empty words to you, for it is your life; and by this Word you shall prolong your days in the land where you are crossing over the Jordan to possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses that same day, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Go up into this mountain of Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, across from Jericho; view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel as a possession;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and die on the mountain which you ascend, and be gathered to your people, even as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>because you have trespassed against Me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because you did not honor Me in the midst of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Yet you shall see the land before you, though you shall not go there, into the land which I am giving to the children of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
