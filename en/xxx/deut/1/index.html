And any matter that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and dreadful wilderness which you have seen on the way to the mountains of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I said to you, You have come to the mountains of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God is giving to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold, Jehovah your God has set the land before you; go up and possess it, as Jehovah the God of your fathers has spoken to you; do not fear or be dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all of you came near to me and said, Let us send men before us, and let them search out the land for us, and bring back word to us of the way by which we should go up, and of the cities into which we shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the thing was good in my eyes; so I took twelve of your men, one man from each tribe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they turned and went up into the mountains, and came to the Valley of Eshcol, and explored it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They also took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us; and they brought back word to us, saying, It is a good land which Jehovah our God is giving to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nevertheless you would not go up, but rebelled against the mouth of Jehovah your God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and you murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Where shall we go up? Our brethren have caused our hearts to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to the heavens; moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then I said to you, Do not be terrified, nor afraid of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jehovah your God, who goes before you, He will fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and in the wilderness where you have seen how Jehovah your God has carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet, for all that, you did not believe Jehovah your God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who went in the way before you to search out a place for you to encamp, to show you the way you should go, in the fire by night and in the cloud by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jehovah heard the sound of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land which I have sworn to give to your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and his children I am giving the land upon which he has walked, because he has wholly followed Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jehovah was also angry with me on account of you, saying, You also shall not go in there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Moreover your little ones and your children, whom you say will be prey, who today have no knowledge of good and evil, they shall go in there; to them I will give it, and they shall possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But as for you, turn and set out into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against Jehovah; we will go up and fight, just as Jehovah our God commanded us. And each of you girded on his weapons of war, and were ready to go up into the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jehovah said to me, Say to them, Do not go up nor fight, for I am not among you; lest you be struck down before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So I spoke to you; yet you would not listen, but rebelled against the mouth of Jehovah, and presumptuously went up into the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the Amorites who dwelt in that mountain came out against you and chased you as bees do, and shattered you in pieces from Seir to Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And you returned and wept before Jehovah, but Jehovah would not listen to your voice nor give ear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So you remained in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
