Thus you shall put away the evil from your midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If your brother, the son of your mother, your son or your daughter, the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your own soul, secretly entices you, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, neither you nor your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>of the gods of the people all around you, near to you or far off from you, from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>you shall not consent to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him or conceal him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but you shall kill him to death; your hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall stone him with stones so that he dies, because he has sought to thrust you away from Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus all Israel shall hear and fear, and not again do such wickedness as this among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If you hear someone in one of your cities, which Jehovah your God gives you to dwell in, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Corrupt men have gone out from among you and impelled the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>then you shall inquire, search out, and ask thoroughly. And if it is indeed true and the matter is firmly established that such an abomination has been done among you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>you shall strike to kill the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword; utterly destroying it, all that is in it and its livestock, with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you shall gather all its plunder into the middle of the open place, and completely burn with fire the city and all its plunder, before Jehovah your God.
