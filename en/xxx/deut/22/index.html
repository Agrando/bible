Thus you shall put away the evil from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then both of them shall die; the man that lay with the woman, and the woman; thus you shall put away the evil from Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a young woman who is a virgin is betrothed to a man, and a man finds her in the city and lies with her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry out in the city, and the man because he has humbled his neighbors wife; thus you shall put away the evil from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if a man finds a betrothed young woman in the field, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you shall do nothing to the young woman; there is in the young woman no sin deserving of death, for just as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for he had found her in the field, and the betrothed young woman had cried out, but there was no one to deliver her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If a man finds a young woman who is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are found out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>then the man who lay with her shall give to the young womans father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife because he has humbled her; he cannot put her away all his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>A man shall not take his fathers wife, nor uncover his fathers skirt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
