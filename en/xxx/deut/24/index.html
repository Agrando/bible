for that is an abomination before Jehovah, and you shall not bring sin upon the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you as an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When a man has taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war nor leave for any business; he shall be free at home one year, and bring gladness to his wife whom he has taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>No man shall take the lower or the upper millstone in pledge, for he takes ones soul in pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man is found kidnapping any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and has treated him as a slave or sold him, then that kidnapper shall die; thus you shall put away the evil from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Take heed regarding the plague of leprosy, that you take great heed to do according to all that the priests, the Levites, shall teach you; as I have commanded them, thus you shall take heed to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Remember what Jehovah your God did to Miriam on the way when you came out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When you lend your brother anything, you shall not go into his house to get his pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you lend shall bring the pledge out to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if the man is poor, you shall not sleep with his pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You shall return and bring the pledge back to him when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his own garment and bless you; and it shall be righteousness in you before Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether one of your brethren or one of the sojourners who is in your land within your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Each day you shall give him his wages, and not let the sun go down on it, for he is poor and is sustaining his soul with it; lest he cry out against you unto Jehovah, and it be sin in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall the sons be put to death for their fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You shall not pervert justice due the sojourner or the fatherless, nor take a widows garment as a pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and Jehovah your God redeemed you from there; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow; and Jehovah your God shall bless you in all the work of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
