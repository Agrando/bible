Do not let your heart faint, do not be afraid, and do not tremble nor be terrified before them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for Jehovah your God is He who is going before you, to engage your enemies in battle, to deliver you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the officers shall speak to the people, saying: What man is there who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle and another man dedicate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And what man is there who has planted a vineyard and has not eaten of it? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle and another man violate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And what man is there who has betrothed a woman and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle and another man take her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the officers shall speak further to the people, and say, What man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? Let him go and return to his house, that the heart of his brethren not melt like his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And so it shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall appoint commanders of the armies at the head of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When you go near a city to fight against it, then proclaim an offer of peace to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it shall be that if they respond in peace and open to you, then all the people who are found in it shall be tributaries to you, and serve you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if the city will not make peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when Jehovah your God has delivered it into your hands, you shall strike every male in it with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the city, all its spoils, you shall plunder for yourself; and you shall eat the plunder of your enemies which Jehovah your God has given to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But of the cities of these peoples which Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance, you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but you shall destroy to exterminate them: the Hittite and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, as Jehovah your God has commanded you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that they not teach you to do according to all their abominations which they have done unto their gods, and you sin against Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When you besiege a city many days, to make war against it to capture it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them, if you can eat from them; do not cut them down. For is the tree of the field a man, to be besieged by you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Only the trees which you know are not trees for food you may destroy and cut down, to build siege works against the city making war with you, until it is subdued.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
