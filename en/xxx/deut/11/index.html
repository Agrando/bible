the eyes of Jehovah your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it shall be that if you give heed to obey My commandments which I am commanding you today, to love Jehovah your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>then I will give you the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will produce grass in your fields for your livestock, that you may eat and be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Take heed to yourselves, that your heart not be deceived, and you turn aside and serve other gods and bow down to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the anger of Jehovah burn against you, and He shut up the heavens so that there be no rain, and the land yield no produce, and you perish quickly from the good land which Jehovah is giving to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore you shall fix these words of mine in your hearts and in your souls, and shall bind them as a sign on your hands, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land of which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers to give to them, like the days of the heavens above the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For if you give heed to keep all these commandments which I am commanding you to do; to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave unto Him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then Jehovah will drive out all these nations before you, and you shall dispossess nations that are greater and mightier than yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the River Euphrates, even to the western Sea, shall be your territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>No man shall be able to stand against you; Jehovah your God will put the dread of you and the fear of you upon all the land where you tread, as He has spoken to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the blessing, if you obey the commandments of Jehovah your God which I am commanding you today;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside from the way which I am commanding you today, to go after other gods which you have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it shall be, when Jehovah your God brings you into the land which you are going in to possess, that you shall put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Are they not on the other side of the Jordan, toward the setting sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the plain opposite Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you are crossing over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you, and you shall possess it and dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And take heed to do all the statutes and judgments which I am setting before you today.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
