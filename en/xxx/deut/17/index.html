Thus you shall put away the evil from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If a matter arises which is too hard for you to judge, between blood and blood, between dispute and dispute, or between stroke and stroke, matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise and go up to the place which Jehovah your God chooses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge who is there in those days, and inquire; and they shall declare to you the judgment of the case.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall do according to the mouth of the word which they declare to you in that place which Jehovah chooses. And you shall take heed to do according to all that they instruct you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>According to the mouth of the law which they instruct you, according to the judgment which they command you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left from the word which they declare to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the man who acts presumptuously to not heed the priest who is standing to serve there before Jehovah your God, or the judge, that man shall die. Thus you shall put away the evil from Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all the people shall hear and fear, and no longer act presumptuously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When you come to the land which Jehovah your God is giving you, and have possessed it and dwelt in it, and say, I will set a king over me like all the nations that are around me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>you shall appoint to establish a king over you whom Jehovah your God chooses; one from among your brethren you shall set as king over you; you shall not designate a foreign man over you, who is not your brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses, for Jehovah has said to you, You shall not return that way again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither shall he multiply wives for himself, that his heart not be turned aside; nor shall he greatly multiply silver and gold for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It shall also be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write for himself a copy of this Law in a book, from the one that is before the priests, the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it shall be with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God, to keep all the Words of this Law and these statutes, to do them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that his heart may not be lifted up above his brethren, that he may not turn aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left, and that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his sons in the midst of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
