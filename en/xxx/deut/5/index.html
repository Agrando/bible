In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle, nor your sojourner who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah your God brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore Jehovah your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Honor your father and your mother, as Jehovah your God has commanded you, that your days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with you in the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You shall not murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You shall not commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall not steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You shall not desire your neighbors wife; and you shall not covet your neighbors house, his field, his male servant, his female servant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that is your neighbors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These words Jehovah has spoken to all your assembly, on the mountain from the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and He has added no more. And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And so it was, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And you said, Behold, Jehovah our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God speaks with man, yet he lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of Jehovah our God anymore, then we shall die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You go near and hear all that Jehovah our God shall say, and you speak to us all that Jehovah our God shall speak to you; and we will hear and do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jehovah heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and Jehovah said to me: I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Oh, that this heart of theirs would be fully yielded, to fear Me and to keep all My commandments at all times, that it might be well with them and with their children forever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Go and say to them, Return to your tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But as for you, stand here by Me, and I will speak to you all the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I am giving them to possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore, take heed to do as Jehovah your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You shall walk in all the ways which Jehovah your God has commanded you, that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
