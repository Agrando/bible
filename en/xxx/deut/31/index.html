I can no longer go out and come in. And Jehovah has said to me, You shall not cross over this Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehovah your God Himself is crossing over before you; He will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua himself is crossing over before you, as Jehovah has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehovah will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites and their land, when He destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehovah will give them up before you, to do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for Jehovah your God, He is the One who is going with you. He will not abandon you nor forsake you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the eyes of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage, for you shall go with this people into the land which Jehovah has sworn to their fathers to give to them, and you shall cause them to inherit it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah, He is going before you. He will be with you; He will not abandon you nor forsake you. Do not fear nor be dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses wrote this Law and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and to all the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses commanded them, saying: At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time in the year of release, at the Feast of Booths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>when all Israel comes to appear before Jehovah your God in the place which He chooses, you shall read this Law before all Israel in their ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Gather the people together, men and women and little ones, and the sojourner who is within your gates, that they may hear and that they may learn to fear Jehovah your God and take heed to do all the Words of this Law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear Jehovah your God all the days you live in the land which you are crossing the Jordan to possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, the day has drawn near for you to die. Summon Joshua, and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, that I may commission him. And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jehovah appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood above the door of the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehovah said to Moses: Behold, you shall rest with your fathers; and this people will rise up and commit adultery with the gods of the foreigners of the land, where they are going in to be among them, and they will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And My anger will burn against them in that day, and I shall forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured. And many evils and troubles shall befall them, so that they will say in that day, Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will conceal to hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore, write down this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When I have brought them to the land flowing with milk and honey, of which I have sworn to their fathers, and they have eaten and filled themselves and grown fat, then they will have turned to other gods and served them; and they will have provoked Me and broken My covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall be, when many evils and troubles find them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten in the mouths of their seed, for I know the imagination of their works even today, even before I bring them into the land of which I have sworn to give to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land of which I have sworn to them, and I shall be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So it was, when Moses had completed writing the words of this Law in a book, when they were finished,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Take this Book of the Law, and put it inside the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, to be there as a witness against you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. If today, while I am yet alive with you, you have been rebellious against Jehovah, then how much more after my death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears and call Heaven and earth to testify against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For I know that after my death you will pervert yourselves to corruption, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days, because you will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song to their conclusion:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
