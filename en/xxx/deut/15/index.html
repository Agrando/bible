From out of whatever Jehovah has blessed you, you shall give to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this thing today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if it happens that he says to you, I will not go out from you, because he loves you and your household, since it has been good for him with you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>then you shall take an awl and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall continue to be your servant. And to your female servant you shall do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It shall not be difficult in your eyes to let him go free from you; for he has served you six years for double the wages of a hired servant. And Jehovah your God will bless you in all that you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the firstborn males that your herd and your flock bring forth you shall consecrate unto Jehovah your God; you shall do no work with the firstborn of your ox, nor shear the firstborn of your sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You and your household shall eat it before Jehovah your God year by year in the place which Jehovah chooses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if there is a blemish in it, if it is lame or blind or has any bad blemish, you shall not sacrifice it unto Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall eat it within your gates; the unclean and the clean alike, as a gazelle or a deer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it on the ground like water.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
