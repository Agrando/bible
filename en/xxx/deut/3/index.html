Behold, his bedstead was an iron bedstead (Is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon.): Nine cubits its length and four cubits its width, according to the cubit of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer by the River Arnon, and half the mountains of Gilead and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All the region of Argob, with all Bashan, was called the land of the giants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and called Bashan after his own name, Havoth Jair, to this day.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I also gave Gilead to Machir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave from Gilead as far as the River Arnon, the middle of the river as the border, as far as the River Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the plain also, with the Jordan as the border, from Chinnereth as far as the east side of the sea of the plain (the Salt Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then I commanded you at that time, saying: Jehovah your God has given you this land to possess. All your men of war shall cross over armed before your brethren, the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in your cities which I have given you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>until Jehovah has given rest to your brethren as He has to you, and they also possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you shall return to his possession which I have given to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God has done to these two kings; so will Jehovah do to all the kingdoms through which you pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall not fear them, for Jehovah your God Himself fights for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then I besought Jehovah at that time, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O Lord Jehovah, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand, for what god is there in the heavens or on earth who can do according to Your works and Your might?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I pray, let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, those pleasant mountains, and Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jehovah was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to me. And Jehovah said to me: Enough from you! Speak no more to Me of this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes toward the west, the north, the south, and the east; behold it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But commission Joshua, and encourage him and make him bold; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So we remained in the valley across from Beth Peor.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
