And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is near the River in the land of the sons of his people, to summon him, saying: Behold, a people has come from Egypt. Behold, they cover the eye of the earth, and are staying next to me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore please come, curse this people for me, for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail and strike them and drive them out of the land, for I have perceived that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the diviners fee in their hand, and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said to them, Lodge here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, as Jehovah speaks to me. So the rulers of Moab stayed with Balaam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God came to Balaam and said, Who are these men with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the eye of the earth. Come now, curse them for me; perhaps I shall prevail to wage war and drive them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Balaam arose in the morning and said to the rulers of Balak, Go back to your land, for Jehovah has refused to give me permission to go with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the rulers of Moab arose and went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Balak again sent rulers, more numerous and more honorable than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they came to Balaam and said to him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for I will honor you with great honor, and I will do whatever you say to me. Therefore please come, curse this people for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the mouth of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore, please, you also stay here tonight, that I may know what more Jehovah will say to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, If the men have come to summon you, arise and go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Balaam arose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the rulers of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Gods anger burned because he went, and the Angel of Jehovah stationed Himself in the way as an adversary against him. And he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way with His sword drawn in His hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. So Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path of the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah, she pushed herself against the wall and crushed Balaams foot against the wall; so he struck her some more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the Angel of Jehovah went farther, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah, she lay down under Balaam; and Balaams anger burned, and he struck the donkey with his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jehovah opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have been cruel to me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would kill you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden, ever since I became yours, to this day? Has it ever been my habit to do this to you? And he said, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jehovah opened Balaams eyes, and he saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way with His sword drawn in His hand; and he bowed down and prostrated himself on his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary against you, because your way is perverse before Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely now I would have killed you, and let her live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Balaam said to the Angel of Jehovah, I have sinned, for I did not know You were standing in the way against me. Now therefore, if it has been displeasing to Your eye, I will turn back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the Angel of Jehovah said to Balaam, Go with the men, but only the word that I speak to you, that you shall speak. So Balaam went with the rulers of Balak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is in the territory at the Arnon, at the border of the territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not reach out to send for you, to summon you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not truly able to honor you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Balaam said to Balak, Behold, I have come to you. Now, am I able at all to say anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath Huzoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and he sent some to Balaam and to the rulers who were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it was the next day, that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, that from there he might observe the extent of the people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
