They shall be for assembling the congregation and for the setting out of the camps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When they blow with them, all the congregation shall gather before you at the door of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if they blow with one, then the leaders, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When you sound the alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall then set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When you sound the alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall set out; they shall sound the alarm for them to set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but not sound the alarm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and this shall be to you as a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when you go to war in your land against the enemy who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, and you will be remembered before Jehovah your God, and you shall be delivered from your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Also in the day of your gladness, at your appointed times, and at the beginning of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be a memorial for you before your God: I am Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now it came to pass on the twentieth of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from above the tabernacle of the Testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the children of Israel set out from the wilderness of Sinai on their journeys; and the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus they first set out at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The standard of the camp of the children of Judah set out first according to their armies; over their army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set out, carrying the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the standard of the camp of Reuben set out according to their armies; over their army was Elizur the son of Shedeur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Kohathites set out, carrying the sanctuary. (The tabernacle had been prepared for them to come.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set out according to their armies; over their army was Elishama the son of Ammihud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan (the rear guard of all the camps) set out according to their armies; over their army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel, according to their armies, when they set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses father-in-law, We are setting out for the place of which Jehovah has said, I will give it to you. Come with us, and we will treat you well; for Jehovah has promised good to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said to him, I will not go, but I will depart to my own land and to my kindred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Please do not leave, inasmuch as you know how we are to camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it shall be, if you go with us; indeed it shall be; that whatever good Jehovah will do to us, the same we shall do to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they departed from the mountain of Jehovah on a journey of three days; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah set out before them for the three days journey, to search out a resting place for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the cloud of Jehovah was above them by day when they set out from the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus it was, whenever the ark set out, that Moses said: Rise up, O Jehovah! Let Your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate You flee before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when it rested, he said: Return, O Jehovah, to the multitudes of the thousands of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
