The city shall be in the middle. This shall be to them as common land for the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And among the cities which you shall give to the Levites you shall appoint six cities of refuge, to which a manslayer may flee. And to these you shall add forty-two cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So all the cities you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight; these you shall give with their common lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the cities which you shall give shall be from the possession of the children of Israel; from the larger tribe you shall give many, from the smaller you shall give few. Each shall give some of its cities to the Levites, according to the inheritance that each receives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>then you shall appoint cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any soul accidentally may flee there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They shall be cities of refuge for you from the kinsman avenger, that the manslayer may not die until he stands before the congregation in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And out of the cities which you give, you shall have six cities of refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall appoint three cities on this side of the Jordan, and three cities you shall appoint in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>These six cities shall be for refuge for the children of Israel, for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them, that anyone who kills a soul accidentally may flee there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he strikes him with an implement of iron, so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be executed to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if he strikes him with a stone in the hand, by which one could die, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be executed to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Or if he strikes him with a wooden implement in the hand, by which one could die, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be executed to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The kinsman avenger of blood himself shall put the murderer to death; when he meets him, he shall put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If he pushes him out of hatred, or while lying in wait has thrown something at him, so that he dies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>or in enmity he has struck him with his hand so that he dies, the one who struck him shall be executed to death. He is a murderer. The kinsman avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>However, if he has pushed him suddenly without enmity, or has thrown anything at him without lying in wait,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>or a stone, by which a man could die, which falls on him without seeing him, so that he dies, while he was not his enemy or seeking his harm;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then the congregation shall judge between the manslayer and the kinsman avenger of blood according to these judgments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the kinsman avenger of blood, and the congregation shall return him to the city of refuge where he had fled, and he shall remain there until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if the manslayer at any time goes outside the borders of the city of refuge where he fled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the kinsman avenger of blood finds him outside the borders of his city of refuge, and the kinsman avenger of blood kills the manslayer, he shall not be guilty of blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return to the land of his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And these things shall be a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Whoever kills a soul, the murderer shall be put to death at the mouth of witnesses; but one witness shall not testify against a soul for him to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Moreover you shall take no ransom for the soul of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall be executed to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you shall take no ransom for him to flee to his city of refuge, to return to dwell in the land until the death of the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus you shall not pollute the land where you are; for blood pollutes the land. And no atonement can be made for the land, for the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of him who sheds it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore do not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell; for I, Jehovah, dwell among the children of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
