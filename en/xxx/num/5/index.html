He shall make restitution for his trespass in full, add a fifth to it, and give it to the one he has wronged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if the man has no relative to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution for the wrong shall go to Jehovah for the priest, besides the ram of the atonement with which atonement is made for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And every mans holy things shall be his; whatever any man gives to the priest shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: If any mans wife turns aside and transgresses in unfaithfulness toward him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and a man has lain with her with the seed of intercourse, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and it is concealed that she has been defiled, and there was no witness against her, nor has she been caught;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, who has been defiled; or if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, although she has not been defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>then the man shall bring his wife to the priest. He shall bring the offering for her, one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it, because it is a grain offering of jealousy, an offering for remembering, for bringing iniquity to remembrance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the priest shall bring her near, and make her stand before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the priest shall make the woman stand before Jehovah, uncover the womans head, and put the offering for remembering in her hands, which is the grain offering of jealousy.

And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall wipe them off into the bitter water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her to become bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the womans hand, shall wave the offering before Jehovah, and bring it to the altar;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and the priest shall take a handful of the offering, as its memorial portion, burn it on the altar with smoke, and afterward make the woman drink the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When he has made her drink the water, then it shall be, if she has been defiled and transgressed in unfaithfulness toward her husband, that the water that brings a curse shall enter into her and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, her thigh shall waste away, and the woman shall become a curse among her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if the woman has not been defiled, and is pure, then she shall be free and shall conceive children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, while under her husband, turns aside and has been defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>or when the spirit of jealousy comes upon a man, and he becomes jealous of his wife; then he shall make the woman stand before Jehovah, and the priest shall pass all this law upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the man shall be free from iniquity, but the woman shall bear her iniquity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
