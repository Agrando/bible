So the name of that place was called Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became impatient on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the people spoke against God and against Moses: Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and our soul loathes this worthless bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many of the people of Israel died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against Jehovah and against you; intercede before Jehovah that He take away the serpents from us. So Moses interceded for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that anyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the children of Israel set out and encamped in Oboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they journeyed from Oboth and camped at Ije Abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From there they set out and encamped in the valley of Zered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Jehovah: Waheb in Suphah, the brooks of the Arnon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the slope of the brooks that extends down to the dwelling of Ar, and leans on the border of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>From there they went to Beer, which is the well where Jehovah said to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well! All of you sing to it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>the well the rulers dug, dug by the nobles of the people, by the Lawgiver, with their staffs. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and from Bamoth, in the valley that is in the land of Moab, to the top of Pisgah which looks down and faces the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into fields or vineyards; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the KingÂ’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. And Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all its villages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and had taken all his land from his hand as far as the Arnon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore those who speak in proverbs say: Come to Heshbon, let it be built; let the city of Sihon be repaired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For fire went out from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the heights of the Arnon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Woe to you, Moab! You have perished, O people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But we have shot at them; Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon; and we laid waste as far as Nophah, which reaches to Medeba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. So Og king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So they struck him, his sons, and all his people, until there was no survivor left; and they took possession of his land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
