According to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances you shall observe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Moses spoke to the children of Israel to observe the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, thus the children of Israel did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there were certain men who were defiled by a dead man, so that they could not observe the Passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And those men said to him, We are defiled by a dead man. Why are we kept from offering the offering of Jehovah at its appointed time among the children of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses said to them, Stand by, that I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Speak to the children of Israel, saying: If anyone of you or your generations is unclean because of a dead person, or is far away on a journey, he shall still observe the Passover unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>On the fourteenth day of the second month, at evening, they shall observe it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break any of its bones. According to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall observe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and has ceased to observe the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from among his people, because he did not bring the offering of Jehovah at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a stranger sojourns among you, and would keep the Passover unto Jehovah, he shall do so according to the statute of the Passover and according to its ordinance; you shall have one ordinance, both for the sojourner and the native of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And on the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the Testimony; from evening until morning it was above the tabernacle like the appearance of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus it was always: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Whenever the cloud was taken up from above the tent, after that the children of Israel would set out; and in the place where the cloud settled, there the children of Israel would encamp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At the mouth of Jehovah the children of Israel would set out, and at the mouth of Jehovah they would encamp; for as many days as the cloud stayed above the tabernacle they remained encamped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When the cloud continued long, many days above the tabernacle, the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah and did not set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So it was, when the cloud was above the tabernacle a number of days: according to the mouth of Jehovah they would remain encamped, and according to the mouth of Jehovah they would set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So it was, when the cloud remained from evening until morning: when the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they would set out; whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud was taken up, they would set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whether it was two days, a month, or a year that the cloud remained above the tabernacle, the children of Israel would remain encamped and not set out; but when it was taken up, they would set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>At the mouth of Jehovah they remained encamped, and at the mouth of Jehovah they set out; they kept the charge of Jehovah, at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
