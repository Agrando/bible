Has He not spoken through us also? And Jehovah heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>(Now the man Moses was very meek, more than any man on the face of the earth.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehovah suddenly said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting! And the three came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehovah came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tent, and summoned Aaron and Miriam; and they both went forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He said, Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, Jehovah, reveal Myself to him in a vision; I speak to him in a dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Not so with My servant Moses! He is faithful in all My house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I speak with him mouth to mouth, even by appearance, and not in riddles; and he looks upon the form of Jehovah. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the anger of Jehovah burned against them, and He departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when the cloud departed from above the tent, behold Miriam was leprous as snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she had leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Aaron said to Moses, Oh my lord I beseech you! Do not lay this sin upon us, in which we have done foolishly and in which we have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I beseech you, do not let her be as one dead, whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his motherÂ’s womb!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses cried out to Jehovah, saying, Please heal her, O Mighty God, I pray!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, If her father had but spat in her face, would she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out of the camp seven days, and afterward she shall be brought in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Miriam was shut out of the camp seven days, and the people did not journey till Miriam was brought in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And afterward the people set out from Hazeroth and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
