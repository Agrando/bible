So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the presence of Aaron their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may serve him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they shall keep his charge and the charge of the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they shall have charge of all the utensils of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you shall give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are assigned to him from among the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus you shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall have charge of the priesthood; but the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And behold, I Myself have taken the Levites from among the sons of Israel instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the sons of Israel. Therefore the Levites shall be Mine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>because all the firstborn are Mine.
