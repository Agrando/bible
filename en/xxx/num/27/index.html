Give us a possession among our fathers brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Moses brought their case before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The daughters of Zelophehad speak what is right. You shall assign to give them a possession of inheritance among their fathers brothers, and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: If a man dies and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his fathers brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the relative closest to him in his family, and he shall possess it. And it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as Jehovah has commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehovah said to Moses: Go up into this Mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For in the wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against My mouth to sanctify Me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah, at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses spoke to Jehovah, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let Jehovah the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>who shall go out before them and go in before them, who shall lead them out and bring them in, that the congregation of Jehovah not be like sheep which have no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehovah said to Moses: Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand upon him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>make him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation, and commission him before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you shall ascribe some of your majesty upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire before Jehovah for him according to the judgment of the Urim. At his mouth they shall go out, and at his mouth they shall come in, he and all the children of Israel with him; all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Moses did as Jehovah commanded him. He took Joshua and made him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
