And the fire of Jehovah burned among them, and consumed those in the outskirts of the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the people cried out to Moses, and when Moses made intercession unto Jehovah, the fire was quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he called the name of the place Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah had burned among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the mixed multitude who were among them lusted after their lusts; and the children of Israel turned back and wept, saying: Who will give us flesh to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>We remember the fish which we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but now our soul is dried up; there is nothing at all except this manna before our eyes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The people went about and gathered it, ground it on millstones or beat it in the mortar, cooked it in pans, and made cakes of it; and its taste was like the taste of juicy oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna fell on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, everyone at the door of his tent; and the anger of Jehovah burned greatly; and it was evil in the eyes of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Moses said to Jehovah, Why have You afflicted Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your eyes, to lay the burden of all these people on me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have I conceived all these people? Have I begotten them, that You say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a supporting father carries a nursing child, to the land which You have sworn to their fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Where would I get flesh to set before all these people? For they weep upon me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am not able to bear all these people alone, because they are too heavy for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If You are dealing with me like this, please kill and destroy me, if I have found favor in Your eyes; and do not let me see my distress!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehovah said to Moses: Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be elders of the people and officers over them; bring them to the tent of meeting, and they shall stand there with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will come down and speak with you there. And I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will lay upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you not bear it yourself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you shall say to the people, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who will give us flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt. Therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and you shall eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but to a month of days, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have despised Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, Why have we come up out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said, The people whom I am among are six hundred thousand footmen; yet You have said, I will give them flesh, and they shall eat for a month of days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to provide enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to provide for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Is the hand of Jehovah shortened? Now you shall see whether My word shall come to pass unto you or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Moses went out and spoke unto the people the words of Jehovah, and he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and laid upon the seventy men of the elders; and it happened, when the Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, although they did not do so again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But two men had remained in the camp: the name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. Now they were among those enrolled, but had not gone out to the tent; and they prophesied in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua the son of Nun, minister to Moses, a youth, answered and said, Moses my lord, stop them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? Oh, that all the people of Jehovah were prophets and that Jehovah would put His Spirit upon them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And a wind went forth from Jehovah, and it brought quail from the sea and left them near the camp, about a days journey here and about a days journey there, all around the camp, about two cubits above the surface of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the people arose all that day, all night, and all the next day, and gathered the quail (he who gathered least gathered ten homers); and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while the flesh was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of Jehovah burned against the people, and Jehovah struck the people with a very great plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>From Kibroth Hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and camped at Hazeroth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
