According to the pattern which Jehovah had shown Moses, so he had made the lampstand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel and cleanse them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of sin offering on them, and they shall pass a razor over all their flesh and wash their clothes, and thus purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And let them take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another young bull as a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting, and you shall gather together the whole congregation of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall bring the Levites before Jehovah, and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and Aaron shall wave the Levites before Jehovah, as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, to serve in the service of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls, and you shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering unto Jehovah, to make atonement for the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons, and offer them as a wave offering unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Afterward the Levites shall go in to serve the tent of meeting. Thus you shall cleanse them and wave them, a wave offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For they are wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel; I have taken them for Myself instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For every firstborn among the sons of Israel is Mine, both man and beast; on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them to Myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the sons of Israel, to serve in the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, that there be no plague among the children of Israel by the children of Israel coming near the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the sons of Israel did to the Levites; according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, thus the sons of Israel did to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Levites were purified and washed their clothes; and Aaron waved them as a wave offering before Jehovah, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Afterward the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons; as Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, thus they did to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is what applies to the Levites: From twenty-five years old and above one shall enter to go forth to serve in the service of the tent of meeting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and at the age of fifty years they shall return from going forth to this service, and shall serve no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, but they shall not serve in any service.
