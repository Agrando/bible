Your dwellings, O Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Like valleys that have been stretched out, like gardens by a river, like aloes planted by Jehovah, like cedars beside the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He makes water flow from his buckets, and his seed in many waters, his king is higher than Agag, and his kingdom is exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Mighty God is bringing him out of Egypt; he has lofty horns like an oryx; he shall consume the nations, his enemies; he shall break their bones and pierce them with his arrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He has crouched, he has lain down as a lion, and as a lioness; who shall arouse him? Blessed is he who blesses you, and cursed is he who curses you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And BalakÂ’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I summoned you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now therefore, flee to your place. I had thought to honor you with great honor, but behold, Jehovah has kept you back from honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the mouth of Jehovah, to do good or bad of my own heart; but what Jehovah speaks, that I will speak?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And now, behold, I am going to my people. Come, I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the latter days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he took up his parable and said, The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor, and the utterance of the man whose eyes are opened;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the utterance of him who hears the words of the Mighty God, and has the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, with open eyes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not near; a Star shall come out of Jacob; a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shatter the extremities of Moab, and destroy all the seats of the sons of Seth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Edom shall be a possession; Seir also, his enemies, shall be a possession; and Israel shall do mightily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Out of Jacob shall be One who has dominion, and has destroyed the remnants of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he looked on Amalek, and he took up his parable and said: Amalek was first among the nations, but his end shall be everlasting destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he looked on the Kenites, and he took up his parable and said: Firm is your dwelling place, and your nest is set in the rock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>nevertheless the Kenites shall be burned up, until Asshur carries you away captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took up his parable and said: Alas! Who shall live when the Mighty God brings this to pass?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But ships shall come from the coasts of Kittim, and they shall afflict Asshur and afflict Eber, unto everlasting destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Balaam arose and departed and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
