It is not a place of sowing or figs or vines or pomegranates; nor is there any water to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tent of meeting, and they fell on their faces. And the glory of Jehovah appeared to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Take the staff; you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation together. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it shall produce water; thus you shall bring water for them out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses took the staff from before Jehovah as He had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock; and he said to them, Hear now, you rebels! Shall we bring water for you out of this rock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff; and water came out abundantly, and the congregation and their cattle drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because you did not believe Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These were the waters of Meribah, because the children of Israel strove with Jehovah, and He was sanctified among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the hardship that has befallen us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt many days, and the Egyptians did evil to us and our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when we cried out unto Jehovah, He heard our voice and sent the Angel and brought us up out of Egypt; now here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through fields or vineyards, nor will we drink water from wells; we will go along the KingÂ’s Highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Edom said to him, You shall not pass through my land, lest I come out against you with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the Highway, and if I or my livestock drink any of your water, then I will pay for it; let me only pass through on foot, without a word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, You shall not pass through. And Edom came out against them with many people and with a strong hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the children of Israel, the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Aaron shall be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against My mouth at the waters of Meribah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; for Aaron shall be gathered to his people and die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses did as Jehovah commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor before the eyes of all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. And Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, all the house of Israel mourned for Aaron thirty days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
