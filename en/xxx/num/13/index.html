And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Go up this way into the south, and go up into the mountains,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and see what the land is: whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, few or many;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>whether the land they dwell in is good or bad; whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or strongholds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>whether the land is fat or lean; and whether there are forests there or not. Be of good courage. And bring some of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, near the entrance of Hamath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they went up through the South and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, those born to Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they came to the Valley of Eshcol, and there cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes; they carried it between two of them on a pole. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they departed and came to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they reported to him and said: We went to the land where you sent us. It truly flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Nevertheless the people who dwell in the land are strong; the cities are fortified and very great; moreover we saw those born of Anak there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South; the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and beside the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Caleb silenced the people before Moses, and said, Let us arise to go up and take possession, for we are able to prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the men who had gone up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they gave the children of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, The land through which we have gone as spies is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great stature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>There we saw the giants, the sons of Anak of the giants; and we were like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and so we were in their eyes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
