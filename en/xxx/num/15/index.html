as it is for you, so shall it be for the sojourner before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>One law and one custom shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Again Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you come into the land to which I am bringing you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>then it shall be, when you eat of the bread of the land, that you shall offer up a heave offering unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall offer up a cake of the first of your ground meal as a heave offering; as a heave offering of the threshing floor, thus shall you offer it up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Of the first of your ground meal you shall give unto Jehovah a heave offering throughout your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If you sin unintentionally, and do not do all these commandments which Jehovah has spoken to Moses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>all that Jehovah has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day Jehovah gave commandment and onward throughout your generations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then it shall be, if it is done unintentionally, without the knowledge of the congregation, that the whole congregation shall offer one young bull as a burnt offering, as a soothing aroma unto Jehovah, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats as a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus the priest shall make atonement for the whole congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them, for it was unintentional; they shall bring their offering, an offering by fire unto Jehovah, and their sin offering before Jehovah, for their unintended sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It shall be forgiven the whole congregation of the children of Israel and the stranger who sojourns among them, because all the people did it unintentionally.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if a soul sins unintentionally, then he shall bring a female goat of the first year as a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus the priest shall make atonement for the soul who sins unintentionally, when he sins unintentionally before Jehovah, to make atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You shall have one law for him who sins unintentionally, for him who is a native among the children of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the soul who does anything loftily, whether he is a native or a sojourner, that one blasphemes Jehovah, and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because he has despised the Word of Jehovah, and has broken His commandment, that soul shall be cut down to be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they put him under guard, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, The man shall be executed to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore, as Jehovah commanded Moses, all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones, and he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Again Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Speak to the children of Israel and say to them to make fringes on the edges of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a violet thread in the fringes of the edges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the fringe shall be, that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of Jehovah and do them, and that you not seek after that for which your own heart and eyes go whoring,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and that you remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
