And the word was true, but the appointed time was long. And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In those days, I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I ate no pleasant food, and no flesh or wine came into my mouth. I did not anoint myself at all until three whole weeks were fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And in the twenty fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Tigris,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>then I lifted up my eyes and looked: And behold, a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold from Uphaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>His body was also like the beryl, and his face looked like lightning. And his eyes were like torches of fire; and his arms and his feet in color like polished bronze; and the sound of his words was like the sound of a multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision. For the men who were with me did not see the vision. But a great trembling fell on them so that they fled to hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me. For my glory was turned within me into corruption, and I had no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yet I heard the sound of his words. And when I heard the sound of his words, then I was on my face, in a deep sleep, and my face was toward the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, behold, a hand touched me, which made me tremble in my knees and in the palms of my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you and stand up, for I am now sent to you. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood, trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to me, Do not fear, Daniel. For from the first day that you set your heart to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. And I have come because of your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the ruler of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days. But, lo, Michael, one of the chief rulers, came to help me; for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now I have come to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is yet for many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he had spoken such words to me, I turned my face to the ground, and I became speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, behold, one resembling the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who stood before me, O my lord, my distress has overwhelmed me because of the vision, and I have no strength left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For how can this servant of my lord speak with you my lord? For as for me, there is no strength left in me; nor is there breath left in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then again, one resembling a man touched me and strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, O man greatly beloved, do not fear. Peace to you. Be strong. Yea, be strong! And when he had spoken to me I was strengthened. And I said, Speak, my lord, for you have strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, Do you know why I have come to you? And now I will return to fight with the ruler of Persia. And when I have gone out, then indeed, the ruler of Greece shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I will tell you what is written in the Scripture of Truth. (And no one holds strong with me in these things, except Michael your ruler.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
