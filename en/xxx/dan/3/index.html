He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges and the justices, and all the officials of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then were gathered the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the justices, and all the officials of the provinces, to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the herald cried with strength: To you it is commanded O peoples, nations, and languages,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that at the time you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you shall fall down and prostrate yourselves before the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And whoever does not fall down and prostrate themselves, at that moment they will be thrown into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So at that time when all the people heard the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and languages fell down, prostrating themselves before the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then at that time certain Chaldeans approached and accused the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live forever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You, O king, have made a decree that every man who shall hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and the bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and prostrate himself before the golden image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whoever does not fall down and prostrate himself, he should be thrown into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There are certain Jews whom you have set over the administration of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, do not give due regard to you. They do not serve your gods nor prostrate themselves before the golden image which you have set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar in anger and wrath commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that you do not serve my gods, nor prostrate yourselves before the golden image which I have set up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now if you are ready, at the time you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, fall down and prostrate yourselves before the image which I have made. But if you do not prostrate yourselves, in that moment you shall be thrown into the middle of a burning fiery furnace. And who is that god who shall deliver you out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If it is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But even if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor prostrate ourselves before the golden image which you have set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and the form of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He spoke and commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than it was usual to heat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he commanded mighty men of valor from his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to throw them into the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then these men were tied up in their coats, their tunics, and their turbans, and their other clothes, and were thrown into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore also, because the kings command was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was startled. And he rose up in haste; he spoke and said to his counselors, Did we not throw three men bound into the middle of the fire? They replied and said to the king, True, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered and said, Behold! I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and there is no harm to them. And the form of the fourth is like the son of a god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace. He answered and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the middle of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the kings counselors gathered around. And they saw these men on whose bodies the fire had no power, and the hair of their head was not scorched, nor were their coats changed, nor was there any smell of fire on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent His Angel and has delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and have changed the kings words, and have given their bodies that they might not serve nor prostrate themselves before any god except their own God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore I make a decree; that every people, nation, and language who speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut into pieces and his house shall be made into an outhouse; because there is no other god who is able to deliver like this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the king made Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego prosper in the province of Babylon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
