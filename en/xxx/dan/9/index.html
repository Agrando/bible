For this reason the curse has poured out on us, and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He has confirmed His Words which He spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us, by bringing on us a great evil. For under the whole heavens it has never been done as has been done to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil has come on us. Yet we did not make our prayer before Jehovah our God that we might turn from our depravities and understand Your truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah has looked on the evil and has brought it upon us. For Jehovah our God is righteous in all His works which He does. For we did not obey His voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and made for Yourself a name, as it is this day; we have sinned; we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O Lord, I pray, according to all Your righteousness, let Your anger and Your fury be turned away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain. For because of our sins and for our fathersÂ’ iniquities, Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach to all those around us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, hear, O our God, the prayer of Your servant and his supplications, and cause Your face to shine on Your sanctuary that is desolate, for the sake of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O my God, bow down Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city which is called by Your name. For we do not make our supplications before You on account of our righteousness, but because of Your great mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, give attention and act! Do not delay, for Your own sake, O my God. For Your city and Your people are called by Your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and prostrating with my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and while I was speaking in prayer, then the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, reached me as I was weary and faint, about the time of the evening sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he informed me and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you skill in understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>At the beginning of your prayers the word came forth, and I have come to explain it. For you are greatly beloved. Therefore consider the matter and understand the vision:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Seventy weeks are decreed regarding your people, and regarding your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make atonement for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Holy of Holies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Know, therefore, and understand that from the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem, to Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks and sixty two weeks. The street shall be built again, and the wall, even in times of distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after sixty two weeks, Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself. And the people of a coming ruler shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end shall be with a flood, and desolations are determined, and there shall be war until the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week. And in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the grain offering to cease. And on a corner will be abominations that cause horror, even until the end. And that which was decreed shall be poured out on the desolate.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
