And the king was thinking to set him over all the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the presidents and satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom. But they could find no occasion or fault because he was trustworthy. And no error or fault was found in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then these men said, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel unless we find it against him concerning the Law of his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then these presidents and satraps gathered together to the king and said this to him, King Darius, live forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects, and the satraps, the officials and the governors, have planned together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except from you, O king, shall be thrown into the den of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the document, so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So, King Darius signed the document and the decree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he had learned that the document was signed, Daniel went to his house. And in his roof room, with his windows open toward Jerusalem, he knelt on his knees three times a day, and prayed and praised before his God, as he did before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then these men conspired together and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they came near and spoke before the king concerning the kingÂ’s decree, saying, Have you not signed a decree that every man who shall ask of any god or man within thirty days, except of you, O king, that he shall be thrown into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is certain, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they answered and said before the king, Daniel, who is of the sons of the captives from Judah, does not show due regard to you, O king, or the decree that you have signed, but he makes his petition three times a day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased with himself, and he set his heart on Daniel, to deliver him. And he labored until the going down of the sun to deliver him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then these men met before the king and said to the king, O king, know that the law of the Medes and Persians is that no decree or law which the king establishes may be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the king commanded. And they brought Daniel, and they threw him into the den of lions. The king spoke and said to Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually will deliver you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den. And the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his nobles, that the matter concerning Daniel might not be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the king rose up at dawn, at daybreak, and hurried to the den of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he came to the den, he cried with a grieving voice to Daniel. The king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, your God whom you always serve, is He able to deliver you from the lions?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>My God has sent His Angel, and He has shut the mouths of the lions. And they have not harmed me, because in His sight innocence was found in me. And also before you, O king, I have done no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the king was exceedingly glad over him. And he commanded to bring up Daniel from the den. And Daniel was brought out of the den, and no harm was found on him, because he trusted in his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel. And they threw them into the den of lions, them, their sons and their wives. And the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones before they ever reached the bottom of the den.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, the nations, and the languages who were living in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I make a decree, that in every domain of my kingdom there shall be trembling and fear before the God of Daniel. For He is the living God and endures forever, and His kingdom is the one which shall not be destroyed. And His rule shall be to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He delivers and rescues, and He works signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth, He who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So this Daniel was made to prosper in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
