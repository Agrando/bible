And there shall be a time of distress, such as has not been since there was a nation until that time. And at that time, your people shall be delivered, everyone that shall be found written in the Book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And many of those sleeping in the earths dust shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to reproach and everlasting abhorrence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the prudent shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and those who turn many to righteousness, as the stars forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But you, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, to the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I, Daniel, looked. And behold, two others stood there, the one on this side, and one on that side of the rivers edge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was on the waters of the river, How long will it be until the end of these wonders?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was on the waters of the river, when he held up his right and his left hand to the heavens and swore by Him who lives forever, that it shall be for a time, times, and a half. And when they have made an end of scattering the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I heard, but I did not understand. And I said, O my lord, what shall be the end of these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Go your way, Daniel! For the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Many shall be purified and made white and tested, but the wicked shall do wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And from the time the regular sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that causes horror is set up, there shall be one thousand, two hundred and ninety days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed is he who waits and comes to the thousand, three hundred and thirty five days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But you, go on to the end, for you shall rest and stand for your inheritance at the end of the days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
