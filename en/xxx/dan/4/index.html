And how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and His dominion is from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house, and flourishing in my palace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I saw a dream which terrified me, and the thoughts on my bed and visions of my head troubled me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the magicians, the conjurers, the Chaldeans, and the fortunetellers came in. And I told the dream before them, but they could not make its interpretation known to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But at last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. And I told the dream before him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As for the visions of my head on my bed, I was looking, and, behold, a tree was in the middle of the earth. And its height was great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The tree became great and strong, and its height reached to the heavens, and it was visible to the ends of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Its leaves were beautiful, and its fruit plentiful, and food for all was in it. The beasts of the field sought shade under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher, even a holy one, came down from the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He cried with might and said this: Cut down the tree and cut off its branches. Shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts flee from under it, and the birds from its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the grass of the field. And let it be wet with the dew of the heavens, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let his heart be changed from that of a man, and let him be given the heart of a beast. And let seven times pass over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the command by the word of the holy ones, in order that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever He wills, and sets up over it the lowest of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I, Nebuchadnezzar, have seen this dream. Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known the interpretation to me. But you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stunned for a time, and his thoughts troubled him. So the king spoke and said, O Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, may the dream be to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The tree that you saw, which became great and strong, whose height reached to the heavens and was visible to all the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and its leaves being beautiful, and its fruit plentiful, and food for all being in it, under which the beasts of the field lived, and in its branches the birds of the heavens had their home:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is you, O king, for you have become great and strong; for your greatness has grown and reaches to the heavens, and your dominion to the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the heavens, and saying, Cut the tree down, and destroy it. Yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the grass of the field. And let him be wet with the dew of the heavens, and his portion with the beasts of the field, until seven times pass over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. And you shall be fed with grass like oxen. And you shall be wet with dew of the heavens; and seven times shall pass over you until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of men, and He gives it to whomever He desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whereas they commanded to leave the stump and roots of the tree: Your kingdom shall be secure to you after you have come to know that Heaven rules.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore, O king, let my advice be acceptable to you: Even break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; so that perhaps there may be a lengthening of your prosperity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At the end of twelve months, he was walking in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The king spoke and said, Is this not great Babylon that I have built for the house of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>While the word was still in the kings mouth a voice fell from the heavens, saying, O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: The kingdom has been taken away from you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be fed with grass like oxen, and seven times shall pass over you until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of men, and that He gives it to whomever He desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>That very hour the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar. And he was driven from men, and he ate grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the heavens, until his hair had grown like eagles feathers, and his nails like birds claws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And at the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to the heavens, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High. And I praised and honored Him who lives forever, whose dominion is an eternal dominion, and His rule from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all those living in the earth are counted as nothing. And He does according to His will in the army of Heaven, and among those living in the earth. And no one is able to restrain His hand or say to Him, What are You doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>At that time my reason returned to me, and the glory of my kingdom, my majesty, and my splendor returned to me. And my counselors and my nobles sought to me. And I was reestablished in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor the King of Heaven, for all His works are truth, and His ways are justice. And He is able to humble those who walk in pride.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
