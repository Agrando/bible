Thus you shall possess their land, as Jehovah your God has spoken to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, that you not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and that you not go among these nations, these remaining among you. You shall not make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause anyone to swear by them; you shall not serve them nor bow down to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but you shall cleave unto Jehovah your God, as you have done to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For Jehovah has driven out before you great and mighty nations; but as for you, no one has been able to stand before you to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>One man of you shall chase a thousand, for Jehovah your God is He who is fighting for you, as He has spoken to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore take diligent heed to your souls, to love Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if you turn back, to go away and cleave to the remnant of the nations; these that remain among you; and make marriages with them, and go in to them and they to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>know and understand that Jehovah your God will no longer dispossess these nations before you. But they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land which Jehovah your God has given to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth. And you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which Jehovah your God has spoken concerning you. All of them have come to pass for you; not one word of them has failed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all the good things have come upon you which Jehovah your God has spoken to you, so Jehovah will bring upon you every evil thing, to destroy you from this good land which Jehovah your God has given to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When you have transgressed the covenant of Jehovah your God, which He has commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed down to them, then the anger of Jehovah will burn against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which He has given to you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
