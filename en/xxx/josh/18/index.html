And the land was subdued before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Joshua said to the children of Israel: How long will you be slack to go and possess the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers has given to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Provide from among you three men for each tribe, and I will send them; they shall rise up and go through the land, plot it out according to their inheritance, and come back to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they shall divide it into seven parts. Judah shall remain in their territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory on the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You shall therefore plot out the land into seven parts and bring the map here to me, and I shall cast lots for you here before Jehovah our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan to the east, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the men arose to go away; and Joshua charged those who went to plot out the land, saying, Go, walk through the land, survey it, and come back to me, and I shall cast lots for you here before Jehovah at Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So the men went, passed through the land, and plotted it out in a book into seven territories by cities; and they came to Joshua at the camp at Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua cast lots for them at Shiloh before Jehovah, and there Joshua distributed the land to the sons of Israel according to their divisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot came out between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Their border on the north side began at the Jordan, and the border went up alongside Jericho on the north, and went up through the mountains westward; it ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The border went over from there toward Luz, beside Luz (which is Bethel) southward; and the border descended to Ataroth Addar, near the hill that is on the south side of Lower Beth Horon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the border extended around the west side to the south, from the hill that lies before Beth Horon southward; and it ended at Kirjath Baal (which is Kirjath Jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This was the west side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The south side began at the end of Kirjath Jearim, and the border extended on the west and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the border came down to the end of the mountain that is before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of the giants on the north, descended to the Valley of Hinnom, beside the city of the Jebusites on the south, and descended to En Rogel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it went around from the north, went out to En Shemesh, and extended toward Geliloth, before the ascent of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then it passed along toward the north side of the plains, and went down to the plains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the border passed along to the north side of Beth Hoglah; and the border ended at the north bay at the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the southern border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Jordan was its border on the east side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to its borders all around, according to their families.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, according to their families, were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, the valley of Keziz,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Avim, Parah, Ophrah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Chephar Haammoni, Ophni, and Gaba: twelve cities with their villages;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Mizpah, Chephirah, Mozah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Zelah, Eleph, Jebus (which is Jerusalem), Gibeath, and Kirjath: fourteen cities with their villages.
