To Esau I gave the mountains of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to what I have done among them. Afterward I have brought you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they cried out unto Jehovah; and He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, brought the sea upon them, and covered them. And your eyes saw what I have done in Egypt. And you dwelt in the wilderness many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought with you. But I gave them into your hand, that you might possess their land, and I destroyed them before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose to make war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I was not willing to heed Balaam; therefore he continued to bless you. And I delivered you out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the lords of Jericho fought against you; also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I delivered them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I sent the hornet before you which drove them out before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword or with your bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have given you a land for which you have not labored, and cities which you have not built, and you dwell in them; you are eating of the vineyards and olive groves which you have not planted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now therefore, fear Jehovah, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers have served on the other side of the River and in Egypt. Serve Jehovah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if it seems evil to you to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers have served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people answered and said: Far be it from us to forsake Jehovah to serve other gods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for Jehovah our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, who has done those great signs before our eyes, and preserved us in all the way that we have gone and among all the people through whom we have passed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehovah drove out before us all the people, including the Amorites who were living in the land. We also will serve Jehovah, for He is our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Joshua said to the people, You cannot serve Jehovah, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous Mighty God; He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If you forsake Jehovah and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do evil and consume you, after He has done you good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people said to Joshua, No, but we will serve Jehovah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Jehovah for yourselves, to serve Him. And they said, We are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore, he said, put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the people said to Joshua, Jehovah our God we will serve, and His voice we will obey!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and established for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And he took a large stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us, for it has heard all the words of Jehovah which He has spoken to us. It shall therefore be a witness to you, lest you deny your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Joshua sent the people away, each to his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being one hundred and ten years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Serah, in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua, who had known all the works of Jehovah which He had done for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in the plot of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of silver, and which had become an inheritance of the sons of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill belonging to Phinehas his son, which had been given to him in the mountains of Ephraim.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
