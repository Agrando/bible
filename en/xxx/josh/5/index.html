Therefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the children of Israel camped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening on the wilderness plains of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the Passover, unleavened bread and roasted grain, on the very same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten the produce of the land; and the children of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, Are You for us or for our adversaries?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He said, No, but as Commander of the army of Jehovah I have now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and prostrated himself, and said to Him, What does my Lord speak to His servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Commander of the army of Jehovah said to Joshua, Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you are standing is holy. And Joshua did so.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
