Behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king. Only its spoils and its cattle you shall take as plunder for yourselves. Lay an ambush for the city behind it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor and sent them away by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he commanded them, saying: Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I and all the people with me shall approach the city; and it shall come about, when they come out against us as at the first, that we shall flee before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city, for they will think, They are fleeing before us as at the first. Therefore we will flee before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city, for Jehovah your God has delivered it into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall be, when you have taken the city, that you shall set the city on fire. According to the word of Jehovah you shall do. See, I have commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Joshua therefore sent them out; and they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; and Joshua lodged that night among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the people of war who were with him went up and drew near; and they came before the city and camped on the north side of Ai. Now a valley lay between them and Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they had set the people, all the army that was on the north of the city, and its rear guard on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hurried and arose early and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at an appointed place before the plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by way of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So all the people of Ai were assembled to pursue them. And they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel. So they left the city open and pursued Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehovah said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin in his hand toward the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And those in ambush rose up quickly out of their place; they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and they entered the city and took it, and hurried to set the city on fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to the heavens. So they had no strength to flee this way or that way, and the people who had fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the others came out of the city against them; so they were caught in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side. And they struck them down, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when they all had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand; all the people of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only the livestock and the spoils of that city Israel took as plunder for themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which He had commanded Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua burned Ai and made it a perpetual heap, a desolation to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening. And as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded and they took his corpse down from the tree, cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raise over it a great heap of stones that remains to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: an altar of whole stones on which no man has wielded an iron tool. And they offered upon it burnt offerings unto Jehovah, and sacrificed peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And there, in the presence of the children of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the Law of Moses, which he had written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all Israel, with their elders and officers and judges, stood on either side of the ark before the priests, the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, the sojourner as well as he who was born among them. Half of them were in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And afterward he read all the Words of the Law, the blessings and the curses, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>There was not a Word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the sojourners who were living among them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
