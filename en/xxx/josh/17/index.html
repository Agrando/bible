And these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they came near before Eleazar the priest, before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the leaders, saying, Jehovah had commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers. Therefore, according to the mouth of Jehovah, he gave them an inheritance among their fathers brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ten portions fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of the Jordan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>because the daughters of Manasseh had inherited an inheritance among his sons; and the rest of Manassehs sons had the land of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, that lies before Shechem; and the border went along south to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the sons of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the border descended to the Brook Kanah, southward to the brook. These cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook; and it ended at the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Southward it was Ephraims, northward it was Manassehs, and the sea was its border. It met up with Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And in Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth Shean and its daughter-villages, Ibleam and its daughter-villages, the inhabitants of Dor and its daughter-villages, the inhabitants of En Dor and its daughter-villages, the inhabitants of Taanach and its daughter-villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its daughter-villages; three high regions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet the sons of Manasseh could not dispossess those cities, but the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it happened, when the sons of Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not drive them out to dispossess them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you given us only one lot and one portion to inherit, since we are a numerous people, inasmuch as Jehovah has blessed us until now?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua answered them, If you are a numerous people, then go up to the forests and clear out a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and the giants, since the mountains of Ephraim are too confined for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the sons of Joseph said, The mountains are not enough for us; and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are of Beth Shean and its daughter-villages and those who are of the Valley of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, saying, You are a numerous people and have great power, you shall not have only one lot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>but the mountains shall be yours. Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and it shall be yours to its extremities; for you shall dispossess the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots and are strong.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
