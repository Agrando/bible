Thus you shall do six days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And seven priests shall bear seven shofars of rams horns before the ark. And the seventh day you shall go around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the shofars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it shall come to pass, when they make a long blast with the rams horn, and when you hear the sound of the shofar, that all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat. And the people shall go up every man straight before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven shofars of rams horns before the ark of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said to the people, Pass along, and go around the city, and let him who is armed go along before the ark of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So it was, when Joshua spoke to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven shofars of rams horns before Jehovah went along and blew the shofars, with the ark of the covenant of Jehovah following behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The armed men went before the priests who blew the shofars, with the rear guard coming along behind the ark, while they proceeded blowing the shofars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout or cause your voice to be heard, nor shall a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, Shout! Then you shall shout.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So the ark of Jehovah went around the city, going around it once. And they came into the camp and lodged in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joshua arose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And seven priests bearing seven shofars of rams horns before the ark of Jehovah proceeded to walk and blew with the shofars. And the armed men went before them, the rear guard coming behind the ark of Jehovah, while they proceeded blowing the shofars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the second day they went around the city once and returned to the camp. Thus they did six days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But it came to pass on the seventh day that they arose early, about the dawning of the day, and went around the city seven times in the same manner. Only, on that day they went around the city seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the seventh time it happened, when the priests had blown the shofars, that Joshua said to the people: Shout! For Jehovah has given you the city!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the city shall be devoted unto Jehovah, it and all who are in it. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we had sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you shall altogether keep from the devoted things, that you not be accursed when you take of the devoted things, and make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are holy unto Jehovah; they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the people shouted when the priests blew the shofars. And it happened, when the people heard the sound of the shofars and the people shouting with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat. And the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joshua had said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the harlots house, and from there bring out the woman and all that she has, as you have sworn to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. And they brought out all her family and set them outside the camp of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they burned the city and all that was in it with fire. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joshua saved alive Rahab the harlot, her fathers house, and all that she had. And she dwells in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah who rises up and builds this city Jericho; he shall lay its foundation with his firstborn, and with his youngest he shall set up its gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thus Jehovah was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout all the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
