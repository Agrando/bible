So they went, and came to the house of a harlot woman named Rahab, and lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men have come here tonight from the children of Israel to search out the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the woman took the two men and hid them; and she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it happened as the gate was being shut, when it was dark, that the men departed. Where the men have gone I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>(But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men pursued them by the road to the Jordan, to the fords. And as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and said to the men: I know that Jehovah has given you the land, that the terror of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as soon as we heard these things, our hearts melted; neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you, for Jehovah your God, He is God in the heavens above and on earth beneath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now therefore, I beg you, swear to me by Jehovah, since I have shown you kindness, that you also will show kindness to my fathers house, and give me a true token,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and save alive my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our souls from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the men answered her, Our lives for yours, if you tell none of this business of ours. And it shall be, when Jehovah gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the side of the wall; she dwelt in the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she said to them, Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you. Hide there three days, until the pursuers return; and afterward you may go your way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men said to her: We will be exempt from this oath of yours which you have made us swear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>unless, when we come into the land, you bind this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you have let us down; and you shall bring your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your fathers household into your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it shall be that whoever goes outside the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his own head, and we will be guiltless. And whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if you tell this business of ours, then we will be free from your oath which you have made us swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet cord in the window.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They departed and went into the mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers sought them all along the way, but did not find them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So the two men returned, descended from the mountain, and crossed over; and they came to Joshua the son of Nun, and recounted to him all that happened to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they said to Joshua, Truly Jehovah has delivered all the land into our hands, for indeed all the inhabitants of the land have melted before us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
