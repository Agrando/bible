Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go, for you have not passed this way before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over before the people. So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day I will begin to magnify you in the eyes of all Israel, and they shall know that, as I was with Moses, so I am with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you have come to the edge of the water of the Jordan, you shall remain standing in the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua said, By this you shall know that the living Mighty God is among you, and that He will destroy to dispossess before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now therefore, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, the waters that come down from upstream, and they shall stand in a heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So it was, when the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and as those who bore the ark came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped into the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks during the whole time of harvest),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>that the waters which came down from upstream stood still, and rose in a heap very far away at Adam, the city that is beside Zaretan. Thus the waters that went down into the sea of the plain, the Salt Sea, stopped, and were cut off; and the people crossed over opposite Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the people had crossed completely over the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
