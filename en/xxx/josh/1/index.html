Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land which I am giving to them; to the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon I have given to you, as I have said to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not abandon you nor forsake you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Be strong and of good courage, for to this people you shall divide as an inheritance the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Only be strong and very courageous, that you may take heed to do according to all the Law which Moses My servant has commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may take heed to do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are crossing over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua spoke, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God is giving you rest and has given you this land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses has given you on this side of the Jordan. But you shall pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>until Jehovah has given your brethren rest, as He has given you, and they also have taken possession of the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them. Then you shall return to possess the land of your inheritance, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they answered Joshua, saying, All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Just as we have heeded Moses in all things, so we will heed you. Only Jehovah your God be with you, as He was with Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whoever rebels against your mouth and does not heed your words, in all that you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
