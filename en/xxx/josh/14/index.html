And they gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their common lands for their livestock and their property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As Jehovah had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the sons of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him: You know the word which Jehovah had spoken to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh Barnea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land, and I brought back word to him as it was in my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt, but I wholly followed Jehovah my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land where your foot has trodden shall be your inheritance and of your sons perpetually, because you have fully followed Jehovah my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now, behold, Jehovah has kept me alive, as He said, these forty-five years, ever since Jehovah spoke this word to Moses while Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now, here I am this day, eighty-five years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As yet I am as strong this day as on the day that Moses sent me; just as my strength was then, so now is my strength for war, both to go out and to come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now therefore, give me this mountain of which Jehovah spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and that the cities were great and fortified. It may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I shall be able to drive them out as Jehovah has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he fully followed Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the name of Hebron formerly was Kirjath Arba (Arba was a great man among the Anakim). And the land had rest from war.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
