You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Joshua and all the people of war with him came against them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and fell upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them and pursued them to Greater Sidon, to the Brook Misrephoth, and to the Valley of Mizpah eastward; they struck them until they left none of them remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joshua did to them as Jehovah had spoken to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua turned back at that time and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor was formerly the head of all those kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one left breathing; and he burned Hazor with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua took and struck with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only, which Joshua burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And all the spoils of these cities and the livestock, the sons of Israel took as plunder for themselves; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they left no one breathing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As Jehovah had commanded Moses his servant, thus Moses had commanded Joshua, and thus Joshua did. He did not turn aside from anything of all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus Joshua took all this land: the mountains, all the south, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, and the plain; the mountains of Israel and its lowlands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>from Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir, even as far as Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings, and struck them down and killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Joshua made war many days with all those kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. All the others they took in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that He might utterly destroy them, and that they might receive no mercy, but that He might destroy them, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And at that time Joshua came and cut off the Anakim from the mountains: from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>None of the Anakim were left in the land of the children of Israel; they remained only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Jehovah had spoken to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
