There were more who died from the hailstones than the sons of Israel had killed with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Joshua spoke to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he said in the eyes of Israel: Sun, stand still over Gibeon; and Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the people took vengeance upon their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of the heavens, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there has been no day like that, before it or after it, that Jehovah heeded the voice of a man; for Jehovah fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was reported to Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joshua said, Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And do not stay there yourselves, but pursue your enemies, and strike their rear guard. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for Jehovah your God has delivered them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it happened, while Joshua and the sons of Israel made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they had finished, that those who had escaped entered fortified cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all the people returned to the camp, to Joshua at Makkedah, in peace. No one moved his tongue against any of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they did so, and brought out those five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua summoned all the men of Israel, and said to the commanders of the men of war who had gone with him, Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings. And they drew near and put their feet on their necks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joshua said to them, Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage, for thus Jehovah will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And afterward Joshua struck them and killed them, and hung them on five trees; and they were hanging on the trees until evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And so at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, cast them into the cave where they had been hidden, and laid large stones against the caveÂ’s mouth, which remain until this very day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>On that day Joshua took Makkedah, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them; all the souls who were in it. He let none remain. He also did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah; and they fought against Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jehovah also delivered it and its king into the hand of Israel; he struck it and all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword. He let none remain in it, but did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish; and they encamped against it and fought against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and struck it and all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that he had done to Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he left him none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>From Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it and fought against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They took it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; all the souls who were in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they took it and struck it with the edge of the sword; its king, all its cities, and all the souls who were in it; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon, but utterly destroyed it and all the souls who were in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and they fought against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he took it and its king and all its cities; they struck them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining; as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had done also to Libnah and its king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Thus Joshua conquered all the lands of the mountains, and the south and the lowland and the wilderness slopes, and all their kings; he left no one remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea as far as Gaza, and all the land of Goshen, even as far as Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>All these kings and their land Joshua took at one time, because Jehovah the God of Israel, fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
