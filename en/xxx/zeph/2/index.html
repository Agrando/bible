It may be that you shall be hidden in the day of the anger of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation. They shall drive Ashdod out at the noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Cherethites! The Word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; I will destroy you so that there shall not be an inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the seacoast shall be meadows, cottages for shepherds, and folds for the flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed on them. In the houses of Ashkelon, they shall lie down in the evening, for Jehovah their God shall visit them and return their captives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the sons of Ammon, with which they have reproached My people and have magnified themselves against their border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore, as I live, declares Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a desolation forever. The rest of My people shall plunder them, and the remnant of the nation shall possess them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall have this for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jehovah will be terrifying to them, for He will make lean all the gods of the earth. Each man from his place and all the islands of the nations will bow to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You also, O Ethiopians, shall be slain by My sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He will stretch out His hand against the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, dry like the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And flocks shall lie down in her midst; all the beasts of the nations; both the pelican and the bittern shall lodge in the capitals of its pillars. Their voice shall sing at the windows; desolation shall be at the threshold; for He will lay bare the cedar work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This is the joyous city, that dwelt confidently, who said in her heart, I am, and there is no other. How she has become a desolation, a place for animals to lie down. Everyone who passes near her shall hiss; he shall shake his hand.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
