Every morning He gives His justice to the light; He does not fail, but the unjust knows no shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have cut off nations; their towers are desolate. I made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are laid waste, without a man, with no inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I said, Surely you will fear Me; you will receive instruction; so that her dwelling should not be cut off, all that I appointed for her. But they rose up early; they corrupted all their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore, wait for Me, declares Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey. For My judgment is to gather the nations, for Me to gather the kingdoms, to pour My fury out on them, all My burning anger. For all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of My jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For then I will transform to the peoples a pure language, to call on the name of Jehovah, to serve Him with one purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, My suppliants, the daughter of My scattered ones, shall bring My offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In that day you shall not be ashamed for all your doings which you have transgressed against Me. For then I will take away out of your midst those who rejoice in your pride, and you shall not again be haughty any more in My holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will also leave a poor and weak people in your midst, and they shall trust in the name of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The remnant of Israel shall not do injustice, nor speak lies. And a deceitful tongue shall not be found in their mouth. For they shall feed and lie down, and no one shall make them afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Cry aloud for joy, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jehovah has taken away your judgments; He has turned away your enemy. Jehovah, the King of Israel, is in your midst; you shall not see evil any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: Fear not, Zion. Do not let your hands be weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jehovah your God is mighty in your midst; He will save. He will rejoice over you with joy; He will quiet you in His love. He rejoices over you with joyful praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will gather the afflicted ones from the appointed place; they were among you, an utterance of reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you. And I will save her who is lame, and gather her who was banished. And I will appoint them for praise and for renown in all the lands where they have been put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At that time I will bring you back, even at the time that I gather you. For I will give you for renown and for praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I return your captives before your eyes, says Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
