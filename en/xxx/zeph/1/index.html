And I will cut off man from the face of the land, declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will also stretch out My hand on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, the names of the idolatrous priests, with the priests;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and those who bow down to the host of the heavens on the housetops; and those who bow, swearing to Jehovah, but also swearing by Melech,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and those drawing back from following Jehovah, and who have not sought Jehovah, nor inquired of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be silent in the presence of the Lord Jehovah, for the day of Jehovah is near. For Jehovah has prepared a sacrifice; He has consecrated the ones He called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall come to pass in the day of the sacrifice of Jehovah, that I will punish the rulers and the kings sons, and all those clothed in foreign apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will punish all those who leap on the threshold in that day, who fill their masters houses with violence and deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it shall be in that day, declares Jehovah, the sound of a cry from the Fish Gate, and a howling from the Second, and a loud crashing from the hills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Howl, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people have perished; all those who carry silver are cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and punish the men who are curdled in their dregs; who say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, nor will He do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation. They shall also build houses, but not live in them. And they shall plant vineyards, but not drink their wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The great day of Jehovah is near; it is near and hastens greatly, the sound of the day of Jehovah. The mighty man shall cry out bitterly there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of desolation and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>a day of the shofar and alarm against the fortified cities, and against the high towers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will bring distress upon men, and they shall walk like the blind, because they have sinned against Jehovah. And their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh like dung.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah. But all the earth shall be devoured by the fire of His jealousy. For He shall make a complete and speedy end of all those who live in the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
