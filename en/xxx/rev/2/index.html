And you have tested those who say they are apostles and are not, and have found them to be liars;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and you have persevered and have patience, and have labored on account of My name and have not become weary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the first works; and if not, I will come to you quickly and remove your lampstand from its place; unless you repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the Tree of Life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write, These things says the First and the Last, who became dead, and lives:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I know your works, affliction, and poverty (but you are rich); and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer. Indeed, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have affliction ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt by the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write, These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I know your works, and where you dwell, where Satans throne is. And you hold fast to My name, and did not deny My faith even in the days in which Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to prostitute themselves to sexual immorality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Repent. But if not, I will come to you quickly and will make war with them with the sword of My mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give some of the hidden manna to eat. And I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no one knows except him who receives it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write, These things says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I know your works, and love, and service, and faith, and patience and your works; and the last being more than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nevertheless I have a few things against you, because you allow that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and lead astray My servants to prostitute themselves to sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I gave her time to repent of her sexual perversion, and she did not repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Indeed I will cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great affliction, unless they repent of their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the inner thoughts and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I will put on you no other burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But hold fast what you have till I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he who overcomes, and keeps My works unto the end, to him I will give authority over the nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He shall rule them with a rod of iron; they shall be dashed to pieces like the potters vessels; as I also have received from My Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and I will give him the Morning Star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
