And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>saying, Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees till we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I heard the number of those who were sealed: One hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel were sealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand were sealed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand were sealed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand were sealed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one was able to number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and crying out with a loud voice, saying, Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and fell on their faces before the throne and did homage to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying: Amen.
