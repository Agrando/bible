But after these things he must be released for a little while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them; and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the Word of God, who had not done homage to the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no authority, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be set loose out of his prison</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and will go out to lead astray the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they went up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the devil, who led them astray, was cast into the Lake of Fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heavens fled away. And there was found no place for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God. And books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, out of the things which were written in the books.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one, according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Death and Hades were cast into the Lake of Fire. This is the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
