The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, These Words are faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show His servants the things which must quickly come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the Words of the Prophecy of this Book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to do homage before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me, Now see here! No! For I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the Words of this Book. Do homage to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to me, Do not seal the Words of the Prophecy of this Book, for the time is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who is unjust, let him be unjust still; he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; he who is righteous, let him be righteous still; he who is holy, let him be holy still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to what his work shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the First and the Last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the Tree of Life, and may enter through the gates into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But outside are dogs and sorcerers and prostitutes and murderers and idolaters, and whoever loves and produces a lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify these things to you, to the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him who hears say, Come. And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take of the Water of Life freely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I testify to everyone who hears the Words of the Prophecy of this Book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add upon him the plagues that are written in this Book;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and if anyone takes away from the Words of the Book of this Prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this Book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who testifies to these things says, Surely I am coming quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
