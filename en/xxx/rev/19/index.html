Salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For true and righteous are His judgments, because He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her sexual perversities; and He has avenged on her the blood of His servants shed by her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And again they said, Alleluia! Her smoke rises up forever and ever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and did homage to God sitting on the throne, saying, Amen! Alleluia!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then a voice came from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all you His servants and those who fear Him, both small and great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard, as it were, the sound of a great multitude, as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia! For the Lord God Omnipotent reigns!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen, pure and bright, for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me, Write: Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he says to me, These are the true sayings of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I fell at his feet to do homage to him. But he said to me, Look out! No! I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Do homage to God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw Heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the armies in Heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and pure, followed Him on white horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He might strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of the heavens, Come and gather together for the supper of the great God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, both small and great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence, by which he led astray those who received the mark of the beast and those who did homage to his image. These two were cast alive into the Lake of Fire burning with brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeded out of the mouth of Him who sat on the horse. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
