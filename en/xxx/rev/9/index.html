To him was given the key to the bottomless pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he opened the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And out of the smoke locusts came forth upon the earth. And to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but to torment them for five months. And their torment is like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will crave to die, and death will flee from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the shape of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. And on their heads something like crowns of gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they had hair like womenÂ’s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots with many horses running into battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. Their authority was to hurt men five months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they had as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>One woe is past. Behold, two more woes come after these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the sixth angel sounded: And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released to kill a third of mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now the number of the army of the horsemen was two hundred million; and I heard the number of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And thus I saw the horses in the vision: those who sat on them had breastplates being fiery like hyacinth and brimstone; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed; by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which came out of their mouths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For their power is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads; and with them they do harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not do homage to demons, and idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, which are not able to see nor hear nor walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they did not repent of their murders nor their sorceries nor their sexual perversions nor their thefts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
