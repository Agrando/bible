And He sent and signified it by His angel to His servant John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>who bears witness to the Word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all things that he saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>John, to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and from Jesus Christ, the Faithful Witness, the Firstborn out from the dead, and the Ruler over the kings of the earth; to Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and has made us kings and priests to God, even His Father; to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will wail because of Him. Even so, Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, says the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I, John, both your brother and companion in the affliction and kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was on the island that is called Patmos because of the Word of God and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I came to be in the Spirit on the LordÂ’s Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last; and, What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamos, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He had in His right hand seven stars, out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His appearance was like the sun shining in its strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, Do not be terrified; I am the First and the Last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
