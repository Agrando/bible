And she will be consumed with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judges her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The kings of the earth who prostituted themselves and lived luxuriously with her will weep and lament for her, when they see the smoke of her burning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>standing at a distance because of the terror of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise anymore:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>merchandise of gold and silver, precious stones and pearls, fine linen and purple, silk and scarlet, every kind of thyine wood, every kind of object of ivory, every kind of object of most precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and cinnamon and incense, ointment and frankincense, wine and oil, fine flour and wheat, beasts and sheep, horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the fruit that your soul lusted for has gone from you, and all the things which are rich and splendid have gone from you, and you shall find them no more at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, will stand at a distance because of the terror of her torment, weeping and wailing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and saying, Alas, alas, that great city that was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For in one hour such great riches is come to nothing. Every shipmaster, all who travel by ship, sailors, and as many as trade on the sea, stood at a distance</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What is like this great city?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and wailing, and saying, Alas, alas, that great city, in which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth! For in one hour she is made desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rejoice over her, O Heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence the great city Babylon shall be thrown down, and shall by no means be found anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters shall by no means be heard in you anymore. No craftsman of any craft shall ever be found in you anymore, and the sound of a millstone shall by no means be heard in you anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the light of a lamp shall not ever shine in you anymore, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall not ever be heard in you anymore. For your merchants were the great men of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were led astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who were slain on the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
