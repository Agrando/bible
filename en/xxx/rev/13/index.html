And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads names of blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled at the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So they did homage to the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they did homage to the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all who dwell on the earth will do homage to him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If anyone has an ear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity; he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to do homage to the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven onto the earth in the sight of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he leads astray those who dwell on the earth by means of those signs which he was granted to do in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it was given to him to give spirit to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not do homage to the image of the beast to be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
