And I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He leads. These were redeemed from among men, being firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And in their mouth was found no deceit, for they are without blemish before the throne of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth; to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; also, do homage to Him who made the heavens and the earth, the sea and springs of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And another angel followed, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual perversion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If anyone does homage to the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His anger. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who do homage to the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is the perseverance of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat One like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And another angel came forth out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And another angel came forth out of the temple which is in Heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another angel came forth out from the altar, who had authority over fire, and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came forth out of the winepress, up to the horses bridles, by a distance of one thousand six hundred furlongs.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
