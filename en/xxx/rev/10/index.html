And a rainbow was on his head, his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he had a little book open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. When he cried out, seven thunders uttered their voices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and do not write them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised up his hand to Heaven</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heavens and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there should be no more time;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, whenever he is about to sound, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke to me again and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So I went to the angel and said to him, Give me the little book.

But when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to me, You must prophesy again before many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
