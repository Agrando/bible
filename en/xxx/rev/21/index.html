Also there was no more sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of Heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I heard a loud voice from Heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He who sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He says to me, Write, for these Words are true and faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He said to me, It is finished! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending. I will give of the fountain of the Water of Life freely to him who thirsts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, prostitutes, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me, saying, Come, I will show you the bride, the Lambs wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, the Holy Jerusalem, descending out of Heaven from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And having a great and high wall with twelve gates, and twelve angels at the gates, and names written on them, which are of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the city is laid out as a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height are equal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he measured its wall: one hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the construction of its wall was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like pure glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: each individual gate was of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it; and the Lamb is its light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And its gates shall not be shut at all by day, because there shall be no night there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles, or produces an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lambs Book of Life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
