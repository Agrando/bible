He was given much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angelÂ’s hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth. And there were noises, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the first angel sounded: And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. And a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the second angel sounded: And something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the third angel sounded: And a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the name of the star is called Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the water, because it was made bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the fourth angel sounded: And a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I saw, and I heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
