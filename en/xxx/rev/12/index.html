And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give birth, in order to devour her Child as soon as it was born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she bore a male Child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her Child was caught away to God and His throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And war broke out in Heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in Heaven any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who leads the whole world astray; he was cast out onto the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I heard a loud voice saying in Heaven, Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they overcame him through the blood of the Lamb and through the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore rejoice, O Heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the dragon saw that he had been cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male Child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
