Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not at all know what hour I will come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You have a few names even in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life; but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, These things says He who is holy, He who is true, He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it; for you have a little strength, have kept My Word, and have not denied My name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but lie; indeed I will make them come and bow the knee before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because you have kept the Word of My perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, I am coming quickly. Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall never go out any more. And I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of Heaven from My God; and My new name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, These things says the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot.

Therefore be zealous and repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
