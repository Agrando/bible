And the angel stood, saying, Arise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who do homage there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles. And they will tread the holy city underfoot for forty-two months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will give to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And if anyone tries to harm them, fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone tries to harm them, he must be killed in this manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>These have authority to shut the heavens, so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when they finish their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them, overcome them, and kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those from the peoples, tribes, tongues, and nations will see their dead bodies three and a half days, and not allow their dead bodies to be put into graves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, make merry, and send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after three and a half days the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great terror fell on those who saw them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they heard a loud voice out of Heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they ascended towards Heaven in a cloud, and their enemies saw them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And in the same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. In the earthquake seven thousand people were killed, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the seventh angel sounded: And there were loud voices in Heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world have been made those of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their thrones fell on their faces and did homage to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>saying: We give You thanks, O Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was and who is to come, because You have taken Your great power and reigned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the nations were angry, and Your wrath has come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and those who fear Your name, small and great, and should destroy those who destroy the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the temple of God in Heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple. And there were lightnings, voices, thunderings, an earthquake, and great hail.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
