He who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering, indeed in order to conquer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that people should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come and see. So I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So I looked, and behold, a pale green horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed behind him. And authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the Word of God and because of the testimony which they held.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And a white robe was given to each one of them; and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both the number of their fellow servants and their brethren, who were about to be killed as they were, was filled up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its untimely figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the heavens separated as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
