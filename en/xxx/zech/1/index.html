But they did not hear nor heed Me, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But My Words and My statutes which I commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? And they turned back and said, As Jehovah of Hosts purposes to do to us, according to our ways and according to our doings, so He has dealt with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I saw by night; and behold, a man riding on a red horse; and he stood among the myrtle trees in the ravine; and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I said, My lord, what are these? And the angel who spoke with me said to me, I will show you what these are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are those whom Jehovah has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they answered the Angel of Jehovah who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still and is at rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the Angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of Hosts, how long will You not have mercy on Jerusalem, and on the cities of Judah, against which You have had indignation these seventy years?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehovah answered the angel who talked with me with good words, words of comfort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the angel who talked with me said to me, Cry out, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion, with a great jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I am exceedingly angry at the nations at ease; for I was but a little angry, and they helped further the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore Jehovah says this: I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion; My house shall be built in it, says Jehovah of Hosts, and a line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Cry out again, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, four horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I said to the angel who talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah showed me four craftsmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I said, What are these coming to do? And He spoke, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifts up his head. But these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations who lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
