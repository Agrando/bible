And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In that day I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness, says Jehovah. And I will open My eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the people with blindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in Jehovah of Hosts, their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In that day I will make the governors of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire among cut grain. And they shall devour all the peoples all around, on the right hand and on the left. And Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be magnified above Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In that day Jehovah shall defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And he who is feeble among them in that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the Angel of Jehovah before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall be in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and supplication. And they shall look on Me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they shall be bitter over Him, like the bitterness over the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In that day the mourning in Jerusalem shall be great, like the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the land shall mourn, each family alone: the family of the house of David alone, and their wives alone; the family of the house of Nathan alone, and their wives alone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>the family of the house of Levi alone, and their wives alone; the family of Shimei alone, and their wives alone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>all the families who remain, each family alone, and their wives alone.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
