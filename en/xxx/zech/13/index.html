And I will also cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And it shall be that when any shall continue to prophesy, then his father and his mother who begot him shall say to him, You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of Jehovah. And his father and his mother who begot him shall thrust him through when he prophesies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it shall be in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed, each one of his vision when he prophesies, and they shall not wear a hairy garment to deceive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But he shall say, I am not a prophet; I am a man who tills the ground, for a man taught me to engage in business from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And one shall say to Him, What are these wounds between Your hands? Then He shall answer, Those with which I was beaten in the house of those who love Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, and against the Man who is My Associate, says Jehovah of Hosts. Strike the Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered. And I will turn My hand on the little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall come to pass in all the land, says Jehovah, that two parts in it shall be cut off and perish, but the third shall be left in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will bring the third part through the fire, and I will refine them as silver is refined. And I will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on My name, and I will answer them. I will say, It is My people, and they shall say, Jehovah is my God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
