And the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth. But the remnant, even he, shall be for our God. And he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will camp around My house because of the army, because of him who passes by and because of him who returns. And an oppressor shall not pass through them any more. For now I have seen with My eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your King comes to you! He is righteous and having salvation, lowly, and riding on an ass, even on a colt, the foal of an ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem. And the battle bow shall be cut off, and He shall speak peace to the nations. And His dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As for you, by the blood of your covenant I have set free your prisoners from the pit, where there is no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope. Even today I declare that I will restore double to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have bent Judah for Me as a bow, filled it with Ephraim, and stirred up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and made you as the sword of a mighty man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jehovah will be seen over them, and His arrow shall go out as lightning; and the Lord Jehovah shall blow the shofar and shall go forth with the tempests of the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jehovah of Hosts shall defend them. And they shall devour and subdue with slingstones. And they shall drink and roar, as with wine. And they shall be full like a bowl, like the corners of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehovah their God shall save them in that day as the flock of His people; for they are as stones of a crown, lifted up as a sign over His land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For how great is its goodness, and how great its beauty. Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
