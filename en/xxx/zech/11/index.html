Howl, O oaks of Bashan, for the inaccessible forest has come down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A voice of the wailing of the shepherds; for their splendor is destroyed. A voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus says Jehovah my God, Feed the flock for slaughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>whose possessors kill them and are not held guilty. And those who sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich. And their shepherds do not pity them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land, says Jehovah. But, lo, I will deliver every man found, each one into his neighbors hand, and into his kings hand. And they shall strike the land, and I will not deliver them out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I fed the flock of slaughter, the truly poor of the flock. And I took two staffs for Myself: the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bonds. And I fed the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I also cut off three shepherds in one month. And My soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I said, I will not feed you; that which dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off. And let the ones remaining, each woman, eat the flesh of her neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I took My staff, Beauty, and chopped it in two, that I might break My covenant which I had made with all the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it was broken in that day, and so the poor of the flock who were watching Me knew that it was the Word of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I said to them, If it is good in your eyes, give Me My wages; and if not, refrain. And they weighed out My wages, thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehovah said to Me, Throw it to the potter, the magnificent price at which I was valued by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I chopped in two My second staff, Bonds, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jehovah said to Me, Take to yourself yet the vessels of a foolish shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land; he shall not visit those who are cut off, nor will he seek the young, nor heal that which is broken, nor will he nourish that which still stands. But he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear off their hooves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Woe to the worthless shepherd who abandons the flock! The sword shall be against his arm and against his right eye. His arm shall be completely dried up, and his right eye shall be totally darkened.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
