And the city shall be captured, and the houses plundered, and the women ravished. And half the city shall go into captivity and the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Jehovah shall go forth and fight against those nations, like the day He fought in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And His feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives shall split in two, from the east even to the west, a very great valley. And half of the mountain shall move toward the north, and half of it toward the south.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you shall flee to the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. And you shall flee as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah. And Jehovah my God shall come, and all the saints with You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it will come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light; the great lights will shrink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it will be one day which shall be known to Jehovah; not day and not night, but it will happen, that there will be light at evening time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in winter it shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah shall be King over all the earth. In that day there shall be one Jehovah, and His name one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All the land shall be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. And it shall rise and dwell in its place, from Benjamins Gate to the place of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananeel to the kings winepresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they shall live in it. And there shall never again be utter destruction, but Jerusalem shall dwell safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this shall be the plague with which Jehovah will strike all the people who have fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh shall rot away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot away in their sockets, and their tongues shall rot away in their mouths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it shall happen in that day, that a great confusion from Jehovah shall be among them; and they shall each one lay hold of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of the surrounding nations shall be gathered together; gold, and silver, and clothing, in great abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And so shall be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, and the ass, and all the beasts which shall be in those camps, like this plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall come to pass, that everyone who is left from all the nations which came up against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to bow down before the King, Jehovah of Hosts, and keep the Feast of Booths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall be, that whoever will not go up from the families of the earth to Jerusalem to bow down before the King, Jehovah of Hosts, even upon them there shall be no rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if the family of Egypt does not go up, nor come in, then they shall have no rain; the same plague with which Jehovah shall strike the nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Booths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This shall be Egypts punishment, and the punishment of all nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Booths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day there shall be on the bells of the horses, HOLY TO JEHOVAH. And the pots in the house of Jehovah shall be like the bowls before the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy to Jehovah of Hosts. And all those who sacrifice shall come and take of them, and boil in them. And in that day there shall not ever again be a merchant in the house of Jehovah of Hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
