And Jerusalem shall be called a City of Truth, and the mountain of Jehovah of Hosts, the Holy Mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: There shall yet be old men and old women sitting in the streets of Jerusalem; and each man with his staff in his hand because of great age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, will it also be marvelous in My eyes? says Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Behold, I will save My people from the land of the rising sun and from the land of the sunset.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will bring them, and they shall live in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be My people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Let your hands become strong, you who hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, that in the day the foundation of the house of Jehovah of Hosts is laid, the temple is to be built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For before these days there were no wages for man, nor any payment for animal; and there was no peace for those who went out or came in because of the enemy. For I sent every man, a man against his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in former days, says Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there shall be peace for the seed: the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its fruit, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it shall come to pass, that as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you shall be a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands become strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, As I purposed to punish you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath, says Jehovah of Hosts, and I did not show compassion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so again I have purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem, and the house of Judah. Do not fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These are the things that you shall do. Every man speak the truth with his neighbor. Judge truth, justice and peace in your gates,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and let none of you devise evil in your heart against his neighbor, and do not love a false oath. For all these things I hate, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Word of Jehovah of Hosts came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be for joy and gladness and cheerful feasts to the house of Judah. Therefore, love truth and peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: There shall yet come people, and the inhabitants of many cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And those living in one city shall go to another, saying, Let us proceed and go make supplication before Jehovah, and seek Jehovah of Hosts; I will go also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And many people and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of Hosts in Jerusalem, and to make supplication before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: In those days ten men out of all languages of the nations shall take hold and grasp the sleeve of a man who is a Jew, saying, Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
