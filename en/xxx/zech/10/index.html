Jehovah shall make lightnings. And He gives them showers of rain, to everyone grass in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For the family idols speak iniquity, and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain. Therefore they wandered like sheep. They were troubled because there was no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the rams. For Jehovah of Hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, and made them as His majestic horse in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>From Him came the cornerstone, from Him the nail, from Him the battle bow, and from Him every ruler together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they shall be like mighty ones who trample the mud of the streets in the battle. And they shall fight because Jehovah is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph. And I will return to save them, for I have mercy on them. And they shall be as though I had not cast them off, for I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Ephraim shall be like a mighty one, and their heart shall be glad as by wine. And their sons shall see and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I will whistle for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them. And they shall multiply as they once multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember Me in far countries, and they shall live with their sons and return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I will bring them back out of the land of Egypt and gather them out of Assyria. And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, until no more room shall be found for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And He shall pass through the sea with distress and strike the waves of the sea, and all the depths of the river shall dry up. And the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt shall be removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will strengthen them in Jehovah, and they shall walk up and down in His name, says Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
