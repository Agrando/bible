And His commandments are not burdensome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For whatever is born from God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world; our faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is He who came through water and blood; Jesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there are three that bear witness in Heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three are into one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God which He has witnessed about His Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed the testimony that God has given concerning His Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked from Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and He will give him life for those who commit sin not unto death. There is sin unto death. I do not say that he should ask about that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he who has been born of God keeps himself, and the evil does not touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Little children, keep yourselves away from idols. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
