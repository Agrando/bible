And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He who says, I know Him, and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But whoever keeps His Word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Brethren, I do not write a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the Word which you heard from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is nothing in him to cause stumbling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you through His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome evil. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the Word of God abides in you, and you have overcome evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For all that is in the world; the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life; is not of the Father but is of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the world is passing away, and its lust; but he who does the will of God abides forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have risen up, by which we know that it is the last hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out that they might be made manifest, that not all of them are of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that not any lie is of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who is a liar but he who denies, saying that Jesus is not the Christ? He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore let abide in you that which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And this is the promise that He has promised us: Eternal Life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>These things I have written to you concerning those who try to lead you astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will remain in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He is revealed, we may have confidence and not be distanced from Him in shame at His coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who produces righteousness is born of Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
