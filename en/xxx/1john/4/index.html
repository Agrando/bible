And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are of the world. Therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born from God and knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who does not love does not know God, for God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In this the love of God was revealed in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have seen and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we have known and believed the love that God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Love has been perfected with us in this: that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment. But he who fears has not been made complete in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We love Him because He first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If someone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how is he able to love God whom he has not seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God also loves his brother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
