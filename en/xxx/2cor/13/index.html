By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I have told you before, and foretell as if I were present the second time, and now being absent I write to those who have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For though He was crucified out of weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know, yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you; unless indeed you are ones failing the test?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I hope that you will know that we are not ones failing the test.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we should appear acceptable, but that you should do what is honorable, even though we may seem to be unacceptable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For we have no power against the truth, but on behalf of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. And this also we pray, that you may be made complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I write these things being absent, that when present I should not use sharpness, according to the authority which the Lord has given me for building up and not for pulling down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Finally, brethren, rejoice. Become complete. Be encouraged, be of one mind, be at peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Greet one another with a holy kiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All the saints greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
