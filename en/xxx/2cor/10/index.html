If anyone is convinced in himself that he is Christs, let him again consider this in himself, that just as he is Christs, even so we are Christs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For even if I should boast somewhat more about our authority, which the Lord gave us for edification and not for your destruction, I shall not be ashamed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>so that I may not seem to frighten you by letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For his letters, they say, are weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word through letters when we are absent, such we are also in deed when we are present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We, however, will not boast beyond measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God distributed to us; a measure which reaches even unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we are not overextending ourselves (as though not extending to you), for we also came as far as to you with the gospel of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>not boasting of things beyond measure, that is, in other mens labors, but having hope, that as your faith is growing, according to our rule, being greatly enlarged to overflowing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>in order to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in anothers measure of accomplishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he who glories, let him glory in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For not he who commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
