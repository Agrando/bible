But I refrain, that no one should think of me above what he sees me to be or hears from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And so that I should not be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan that he might buffet me, that I should not be made haughty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Concerning this thing I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness. Therefore most gladly I will rather exult in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for ChristÂ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have become foolish in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing was I inferior to the most eminent apostles, though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be burdensome to you; for I do not seek what is yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But be that as it may, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I urged Titus, and sent our brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again, do you think that we defend ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ. But we do all things, beloved, for your edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and that I shall be found by you such as you do not wish; lest there be contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, evil speakings, whisperings, conceits, commotions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that it not be, when I come again, that my God will humble me among you, and I shall mourn for many who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, sexual perversities, and licentiousness which they have practiced.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
