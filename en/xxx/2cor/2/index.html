For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one through you in the person of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>so that Satan should not take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his purposes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach ChristÂ’s gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us manifests the aroma of His knowledge in every place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To the one we are the aroma of death leading to death, and to the other the aroma of life leading to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For we are not, as so many, peddling the Word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ, in the sight of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
