Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him thus no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now all things are from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the Word of reconciliation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ. As God is exhorting through us, we beseech you on ChristÂ’s behalf, Be reconciled to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
