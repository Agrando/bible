Or if we are encouraged, it is for your comfort and salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And our hope for you is steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you will partake of the comfort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened exceedingly, beyond strength, so that we despaired even of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver us, in whom we hope that He will still deliver us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks may be given through many persons on our behalf for the gracious gift granted to us by many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For our rejoicing is this: the testimony of our conscience, that we conducted ourselves in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, and more abundantly toward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For we are not writing any other things to you than what you read or understand. And I hope you will understand, even to the end</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(as also you have understood us in part), that we are your rejoicing as you also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in this confidence I intended to come to you before now, that you might have a second benefit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to journey on through you to Macedonia, to come again from Macedonia to you, and be sent by you on towards Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, when I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be Yes, Yes, and No, No?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But as God is faithful, our word to you was not Yes and No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us; through me, Silvanus, and Timothy; was not Yes and No, but in Him was Yes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For as many promises as are of God, in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen, unto the glory of God through us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us is God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who also has sealed us and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover I call God as witness against my soul, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers of your joy; for by faith you stand.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
