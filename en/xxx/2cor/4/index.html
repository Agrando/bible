Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is achieving for us a surpassing and eternal weight of glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>while we do not contemplate the things which are seen, but the things which are not seen.
