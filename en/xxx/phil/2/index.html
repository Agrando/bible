but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, that I should not have sorrow upon sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore I send him the more eagerly, that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less sorrowful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men in honor;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because for the work of Christ he came close to death, not regarding his life, to supply what was lacking in your service toward me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
