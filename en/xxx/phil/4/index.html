Again I say, rejoice!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Let your fairness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy; think on these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, do these, and the God of peace will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last your care for me has flourished again, though you surely did care, but you lacked opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in everything I am taught both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to lack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have strength for all things in Christ who strengthens me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nevertheless you have done well that you shared in my distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me concerning giving and receiving but you only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For even in Thessalonica you sent aid once and again for my necessities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that abounds to your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Indeed I have all and abound. I am full, having received from Epaphroditus the things sent from you, a sweet-smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All the saints greet you, but especially those who are of CaesarÂ’s household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
