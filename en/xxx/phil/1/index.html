Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I live on in the flesh, this will mean fruit from my labor; yet what I shall choose I do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I am hard pressed between the two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nevertheless to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And being persuaded of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only, let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and not in any way terrified by your adversaries, which is to them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
