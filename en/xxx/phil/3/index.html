For me to write the same things to you is not tedious, but for you it is safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For we are the circumcision, who serve God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>though I also might have confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I more so:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; according to the Law, a Pharisee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the Law, blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss because of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But no, rather, I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as refuse, that I may gain Christ</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold, since Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Brethren, I do not count myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and stretching forward to those things which are ahead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore let us, as many as are complete, be of this mind; and if in anything you think differently, God will reveal even this to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Nevertheless, to the degree that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us be of the same mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Brethren, join in being imitators of me, and note those who so walk, as you have us for a pattern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For many conduct themselves, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and who glory in their shame; who set their mind on earthly things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For our citizenship is in Heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
