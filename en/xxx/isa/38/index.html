And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and said, Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done what is good in Your eyes. And Hezekiah wept with a great weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then came the Word of Jehovah to Isaiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Go and say to Hezekiah: Thus says Jehovah the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add to your days fifteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And this shall be a sign to you from Jehovah that Jehovah will do this thing that He has spoken:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>behold, I will bring back the shadow which has gone down the steps on the sundial of Ahaz, ten steps backward. So the sun returned ten steps, by which it had gone down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This is the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I said at the end of of my days, I shall go to the gates of Sheol; I am deprived of the rest of my years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I said, I shall not see YAH, Jehovah, in the land of the living; I shall look on man no more among the inhabitants of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My generation is plucked up and removed from me like a shepherdÂ’s tent; I have cut off my life like a weaver; He will cut me off from the loom; from day even to night You make an end of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have been still until morning; as a lion, so He breaks all my bones; from day even until night You make an end of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Like a twittering swallow, so I chatter; I mourn as a dove; my eyes look weakly to the heights. O Jehovah, I am distressed; be surety for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What shall I say? He has spoken to me, and He Himself has acted; I shall go slowly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O Jehovah, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit; so You will restore me to health and make me live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, instead of peace I was bitter with bitterness; but You have delighted in delivering my soul from the pit of corruption. You have cast all my sins behind Your back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Sheol cannot thank You, death cannot praise You; those who go down into the pit cannot hope for Your truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The living, the living man, he shall praise You, as I do this day; the father shall make Your truth known to the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jehovah is there to save me; therefore we will sing my songs with the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs and rub it on the boil, and he shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
