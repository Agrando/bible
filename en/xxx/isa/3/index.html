The youth will be insolent against the elder, and the dishonorable against the honorable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When a man shall take hold of his brother, in his fatherÂ’s house, saying, You have clothing! Come, you be our ruler; let this ruin be under your power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In that day he shall lift himself up and say, I cannot be one who binds up; for there is neither bread nor clothing in my house; do not make me a ruler of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen; because their tongue and their deeds are rebellion toward Jehovah and against the eyes of His glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The expression of their faces witnesses against them; they have declared their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have recompensed evil upon themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Say to the righteous that it is well; for they shall eat of the fruit of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Woe to the wicked! For the evil, the recompense of his hand, shall be done unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As for My people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O My people, those leading you cause you to go astray, and they swallow the way of your paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovah stands up to plead His case, and stands up to judge the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of His people, and their rulers. For you have eaten up the vineyard, the plunder of the poor is in your houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What do you mean that you crush My people, and grind the faces of the poor? says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Furthermore Jehovah says, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched out necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and make a tinkling with their feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>therefore Jehovah will attach scabs to the top of the head of the daughters of Zion; and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and their headbands, and their crescents of the moon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the turbans, and the leg ornaments, and the sashes, and the perfume boxes, and the amulets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>the rings and nose jewels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>the festal apparel and the outer garments; and the mantles, and the purses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>the mirrors and the fine linen; and the turbans and the veils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall be, instead of a smell of perfume, there shall be an odor of decay. And instead of a belt, a rope. And instead of well set hair, baldness. And instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall sit desolate on the ground.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
