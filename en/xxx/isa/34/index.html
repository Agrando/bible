He has utterly destroyed them, He has delivered them to the slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Also their slain shall be thrown out, and their stench shall come up out of their corpses, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And all the host of the heavens shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll; and all their host shall wither, as a leaf withers off the vine, and as fruit falling from the fig tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For My sword is drenched in the heavens. Behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of My curse, for judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The sword of Jehovah is filled with blood; it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Jehovah has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the oryx shall come down with them, and the young bulls with the mighty; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For it is the day of JehovahÂ’s vengeance, the year of retribution for the strife against Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And its streams shall be turned into pitch, and its dust into brimstone, and its land shall become burning pitch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It shall not be quenched night or day; its smoke shall ascend forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste; no one shall pass through it forever and forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; the owl also, and the raven, shall dwell in it. And He shall stretch out over it the line of chaos, and the stones of emptiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but no one shall be there, and all its rulers shall be nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in its fortresses; and it shall be a habitation of dragons and a dwelling for young owls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the howling beasts; and the shaggy goat shall cry to his fellow. The night creature also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There the great owl shall make her nest, and lay and hatch, and gather them under her shadow; there shall the birds of prey also be gathered, every one with her mate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Search from the book of Jehovah, and read; not one of these shall fail, not one shall lack her mate; for My mouth has commanded, and His Spirit has gathered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He has cast the lot for them, and His hand has divided it unto them by measuring line; they shall possess it perpetually, from generation to generation they shall dwell in it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
