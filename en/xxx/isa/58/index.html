They ask of Me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in drawing near to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They say, Why have we fasted, and You do not see? Why have we afflicted our souls, and You take no notice? Behold, in the day of your fast you devise pleasures, and oppress all your laborers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to strike with the fist of wickedness; you shall not fast as you do today, to make your voice heard on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is it such a fast that I have chosen? A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast and a day pleasing to Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Is not this the fast that I have chosen: To loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Is it not to break your bread to the hungry, and that you should bring home the wandering poor? When you see the naked to cover him; and not hide yourself from your own flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then shall your light break forth as the dawn, and your health shall spring forth speedily; and your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of Jehovah shall bring up the rear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then you shall call, and Jehovah will answer; you shall cry out, and He shall say, Here I am. If you take the yoke away from your midst, the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and if you extend your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall your light shine in the darkness, and your darkness shall be as the noonday.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah shall guide you continually and satisfy your soul in dry places, and make your bones fat; and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And those from among you shall build the old ruins; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called, The Repairer of the Breach, The Restorer of Paths to Dwell in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If you turn back your foot, on the Sabbath, from doing what you please on My holy days, and call the Sabbath a delight, the sacred of Jehovah, honorable; and shall honor Him, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>then you shall delight yourself in Jehovah; and I will cause you to ride on the high places of the earth, and feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father. The mouth of Jehovah has spoken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
