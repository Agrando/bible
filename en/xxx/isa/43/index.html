When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned; nor shall the flame consume you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I am Jehovah your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I gave Egypt for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Since you were precious in My eyes, you have been honored, and I have loved you; therefore I will give men for you, and people for your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Fear not, for I am with you. I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Do not keep back; bring My sons from afar and My daughters from the ends of the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>everyone who is called by My name; for I have created him for My glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Bring out the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled. Who among them can declare this and cause us to hear former things? Let them bring out their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You are My witnesses, says Jehovah, and My servant whom I have chosen; that you may know and believe Me, and understand that I am He. Before Me no god was formed, nor shall there be after Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I, even I, am Jehovah; and there is no one to save besides Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have declared and have saved, and I have shown, when there was no strange god among you; therefore you are My witnesses, says Jehovah, that I am the Mighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea, before the day was, I am He; and no one can deliver out of My hand; I work, and who will reverse it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought them all down as fugitives, and the Chaldeans, who shout in their ships.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I am Jehovah, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says Jehovah, Who makes a way in the sea and a path through the mighty waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Who brings out the chariot and horse, the army and the power: They shall lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinguished, they are quenched like a wick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do not remember the former things, nor consider the things of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall you not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The beasts of the field shall honor Me, the dragons and the young owls; because I give waters in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This people that I have formed for Myself; they shall declare My praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you have not called upon Me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of Me, O Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You have not brought Me the lamb of your burnt offerings; nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not caused you to serve with an offering, nor wearied you with incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You have bought Me no sweet cane with money, nor have you filled Me with the fat of your sacrifices; but you have burdened Me with your sins; you have wearied Me with your iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake, and will not remember your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Bring to My remembrance; let us enter into judgment together; declare yourself, that you may be justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Your first father has sinned, and has mocked and rebelled against Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore I will defile the rulers of the sanctuary, and will give Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
