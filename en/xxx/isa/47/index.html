There is no throne for you, O daughter of the Chaldeans. For you shall no more be called tender and delicate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Take the millstones and grind meal. Uncover your veil, strip off the skirt, bare the thigh, pass through the rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, your shame shall be seen; I will take vengeance and I will not meet you as a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Our Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts is His name, the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Sit in silence, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for you shall no more be called the Queen of Kingdoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I was angry with My people, I have polluted My inheritance, and given them into your hand. You have shown them no mercy; upon the aged you have laid your yoke very heavily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you said, I shall be a queen forever; so you did not lay these things to heart, nor remember the latter end of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now therefore hear this, O voluptuous one, who lives securely; who says in her heart, I am, and there is no one else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, nor shall I know the loss of children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day: The loss of children, and widowhood. They shall come upon you in their fullness for the multitude of your sorceries, and for the great power of your enchantments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For you have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, No one sees me. Your wisdom and your knowledge have perverted you; and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is no one else besides me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore evil shall come upon you, and you shall not know its origin. And disaster shall fall upon you, and you shall not be able to cover it over. And desolation shall come upon you suddenly, which you shall not be informed of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Stand now with your charms, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have labored since your youth. Perhaps you will be able to profit; perhaps you may prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You are wearied by your many counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers and the fortunetellers step forth and save you from what shall come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them. They shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame; it shall not be a coal to be warmed with; nor a fire in front of which to sit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus shall they be to you with whom you have labored, your merchants from your youth. They shall wander, each one, to his own region; no one shall save you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
