Where, then, is the house that you would build for Me? And where is the place of My rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For all those My hand has made, and all those exist, says Jehovah. But to this one will I have regard: To the lowly and contrite of spirit, and the one who trembles at My Word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He who kills an ox is as if he killed a man; he who sacrifices a lamb is as if he broke a dogs neck; he who offers an offering is as if he offered swines blood; he who burns incense is as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I also will choose the things that delude them, and I will bring their fears upon them, because when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they have not obeyed. But they did evil before My eyes and have chosen that in which I have not delighted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hear the Word of Jehovah, you who tremble at His Word: Your brothers who hated you, who cast you out because of My name, said, Let Jehovah be glorified. But He will appear for your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A roaring sound from the city, a sound from the temple, the sound of Jehovah repaying His enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Before she writhed in labor, she gave birth; before her pangs came, she delivered a male child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall the earth give birth in one day? Or shall a nation be born at once? For as soon as Zion had gone into labor, she had brought forth her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth, says Jehovah? Shall I beget, and then restrain the womb? says your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you who love her. Rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn for her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that you may suckle and be satisfied with her comforting breasts; that you may suck milk and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like a flowing stream. Then you shall suckle, you shall be carried on her sides and be dandled upon her knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the grass. And the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward His servants, and His indignation toward His enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For behold, Jehovah will come with fire and with His chariots like a tempest, to refresh His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For by fire and by His sword Jehovah will judge all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Those who sanctify themselves, and purify themselves to go into the garden after an idol that is in its midst, eating swines flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall come to an end together, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know their works and their thoughts. It shall come to pass that I will gather all the nations and tongues; and they shall come and see My glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will set a sign among them. And those among them who escape I will send to the nations; to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud (who draw the bow), to Tubal, and Javan; to the far away coasts that have not heard of My fame, nor seen My glory. And they shall declare My glory among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they shall bring all your brothers for an offering to Jehovah out of all nations on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem, says Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me, says Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, all flesh shall come to bow down before Me, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they shall go out and observe the dead corpses of the men who have rebelled against Me. For their worm does not die, nor is their fire quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
