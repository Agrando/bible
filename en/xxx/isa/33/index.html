When you stop destroying, you shall be destroyed. When you stop betraying, they shall betray you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>O Jehovah, be gracious to us; we have waited for You. Be their arm every morning; our salvation also in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>At the sound of the tumult the people have fled; at the lifting up of Yourself the nations have been scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And your spoils shall be gathered as the locust gathers; as the running to and fro of locusts he shall run upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehovah is exalted, for He dwells on high. He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Wisdom and knowledge shall be the steadfastness of your times, and the strength of salvation; the fear of Jehovah is His treasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, their mighty ones shall cry outside; the messengers of peace shall weep bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The highways lie waste, the traveler ceases. He has broken the covenant. He has despised the cities. He has had regard for no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The earth mourns and has grown feeble. Lebanon is ashamed and withers; Sharon is like a wilderness; Bashan and Carmel are shaken out like empty fruit trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now I will arise, says Jehovah; now I will be exalted; now I will lift up Myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You shall conceive chaff, you shall bring forth stubble; your breath, like fire, shall devour you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the people shall be like the burnings of lime; like thorns cut up they shall be burned in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You who are far off, hear what I have done; and you who are near, perceive and know My might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has taken hold of the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who walks righteously and speaks with equity; he who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands free from holding bribes, who stops his ear from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>he shall dwell on high; his refuge shall be the strongholds of rocks; bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your eyes shall see the King in His beauty; they shall behold the land that is very far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Your heart shall muse on terror. Where is the scribe? Where is the one who weighs? Where is the one who counts the towers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall not see a fierce people, a people of unintelligible speech that you cannot perceive; of a stammering tongue that you cannot understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed meetings; your eyes shall see Jerusalem, a quiet home, a tent that shall not be taken down; not one of its stakes shall ever be removed, nor shall any of its cords be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But there the glorious Jehovah will be to us a place of broad rivers and streams, in which no galley with oars shall go, nor shall majestic ships pass by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our Lawgiver, Jehovah is our King; He will save us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Your ropes are loosened, they could not hold the base of the mast, they could not spread the sail. Then the prey of a great plunder is divided; the lame take the spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the iniquity of the people who dwell there shall be taken away.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
