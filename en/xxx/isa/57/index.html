Against whom do you make a wide mouth and stick out the tongue? Are you not children of transgression, a seed of deception,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>being inflamed with gods under every green tree, slaughtering the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Among the smooth stones of the stream is your portion; they, even they, are your lot; even to them you have poured a drink offering, you have offered a food offering. Should I be comforted over these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On a lofty and high mountain you have set your bed; even there you went up to offer sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also behind the doors and the posts you have set up your memorials; for you uncovered yourself and went up to those other than Me. You enlarged your bed and made a covenant with them; you have loved to experience their bed first hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you went to the king with ointment, and increased your perfumes, and sent your messengers far away, and lowered yourself even to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You are wearied in the length of your way; yet you did not say, There is no hope! You found life in your hand; therefore you were not weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And of whom have you been afraid or feared, that you have lied and have not remembered Me, nor laid it to your heart? Have I not been silent, even for a long time, and you did not fear Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will declare your righteousness, and your works; for they shall not be of any benefit to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you; but the wind shall carry them all away; a breath shall take them. But he who puts his trust in Me shall possess the land, and shall inherit My holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He shall say, Raise up! Raise up! Clear a path! Remove the stumbling block out of the way of My people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and consecrated place, even with the contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry; for the spirit would grow faint before Me, and the souls I have made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry and struck him; I hid Myself and was angry, and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have seen his ways, and will heal him. I will also lead him, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off, and to him who is near, says Jehovah; and I will heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked are like the troubled sea, which cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
