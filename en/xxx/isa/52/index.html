Awake! Put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful robes, O Jerusalem, the Holy City. For never again shall the uncircumcised and unclean come into you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Shake yourself from the dust; rise up! Sit down, Jerusalem! Loose yourself from your neckbands, O captive daughter of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For thus says Jehovah, You have sold yourselves for nothing; and you shall be redeemed without silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus says the Lord Jehovah, My people went down before into Egypt to stay there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now therefore, what have I here, says Jehovah, that My people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule make them howl, says Jehovah; and My name is continually blasphemed every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore My people shall know My name. Thus it shall be in that day, for I am He who speaks; behold, it is I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him bringing good tidings, proclaiming peace; bringing good news, proclaiming salvation; who says to Zion, Your God reigns!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Your watchmen shall lift up the voice! They shall lift up the voice together in a resounding cry; for they shall see eye to eye, when Jehovah brings Zion back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Break forth together into a resounding cry of joy, you waste places of Jerusalem! For Jehovah has comforted His people; He has redeemed Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jehovah has bared His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Depart! Depart! Go out from there! Touch not the unclean. Go out of her midst; purify yourselves, you who bear the vessels of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For you shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight; for Jehovah will go before you; and the God of Israel gathers you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, My Servant shall deal with insight; He shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Just as many were astonished at You (His appearance was disfigured more than any man, and His form more than the sons of mankind);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so shall He sprinkle many nations. Kings shall shut their mouths at Him; for that which had not been told to them, they shall see; and what they had not heard, they shall consider.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
