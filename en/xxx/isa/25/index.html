The shouting of the terrible ones shall be pruned away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And on this mountain Jehovah of Hosts will make a feast of fatness for all the people, a feast of the dregs of wine, of fat things full of marrow, of the dregs of refined wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And He will destroy on this mountain the surface of the covering wrapped over all people, and the veil that is woven over all nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from all faces.
