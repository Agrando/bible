They shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, says Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it shall come to pass in that day that the glory of Jacob shall be laid low, and the fatness of his flesh shall be made lean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it shall be as the gathering of grain at harvest, and his arm reaps the heads of grain. And it shall be as he who gathers heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, like the shaking of an olive tree, where two or three ripe olives are in the top of the uppermost branch, with four or five in the fruitful branches of it, says Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In that day a man shall look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, nor respect that which his fingers have made, neither the groves nor idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In that day his strong cities shall be like a forsaken branch, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel; and it shall become a desolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not been mindful of the Rock of your strength, therefore you shall plant pleasant plants and shall set strange shoots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In the day you shall fence in your planting; and in the morning you shall make your seed sprout. But the harvest shall be a heap in the day of sickness and incurable pain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Woe to the multitude of many people, who make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations who make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters; but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far away, and shall be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the tempest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>At evening time, behold, terror! Before the morning, he is no more! This is the portion of those who plunder us, and the lot of those who rob us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
