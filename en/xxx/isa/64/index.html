That the mountains would quake at Your presence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>as the brushwood fire burns, as the fire causes water to boil; to make Your name known to Your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at Your presence!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When You did awesome things which we did not look for, You came down, the mountains shook at Your presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For since ancient times they have not heard, nor been obedient. Eye has not seen any god besides You, who works for him who waits for Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember You in Your ways (Behold, You were angry, for we sinned continually), and we shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But we are all like an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are like a menstruation cloth. And we all fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there is no one who calls upon Your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us, and have melted us away because of our iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But now, O Jehovah, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You are the One who forms us; and we all are the work of Your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not be greatly furious, O Jehovah, nor remember iniquity forever. Behold, please look. We all are Your people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Your holy cities are a wilderness; Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem is a desolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised You, is burned up with fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Will You restrain Yourself over these things, O Jehovah? Will You be silent and greatly afflict us?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
