And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For He grows up before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out of the dry ground. He has no form nor splendor that we should regard Him, nor anything spectacular that we should desire Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He is despised and rejected by men; a Man of pain, and knowing infirmity; a hiding of faces; being despised, we have esteemed Him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Truly He has borne our sicknesses, and carried our pain; yet we esteemed Him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, each one to his own way; and Jehovah has laid upon Him the iniquity of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He has been oppressed, and He was afflicted; yet He opens not His mouth. He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter; and as a sheep before its shearers is mute, so He opens not His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall declare His generation? For He was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgression of My people He was stricken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And His grave was assigned with the wicked, and with the rich in His death; although He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yet it pleased Jehovah to crush Him; to grieve Him; that He should give His soul as a sin-offering. He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, and the delight of Jehovah shall prosper in His hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He shall see the travail of His soul, and shall be fulfilled. By His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify many; for He shall bear their iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I will apportion to Him with the great, and He shall divide the spoils with the strong; because He has poured out His soul unto death; and He was reckoned among the transgressors; and He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
