And the idols of Egypt shall tremble at His presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in its midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I will set Egyptians against Egyptians; and they shall fight each man against his brother, and each against his neighbor; city against city, kingdom against kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of it, and I will destroy their counsel. And they shall inquire of the idols, and the sorcerers, and the mediums, and the fortunetellers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I will give Egypt over into the hand of a cruel master; and a fierce king shall rule over them, says the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And rivers shall be odious from the stench; the Nile of Egypt will languish and dry up; the reeds and the rushes shall wither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Bare places by the Nile, by the mouth of the Nile; and everything sown by the Nile shall dry up, be driven away, and be no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The fishermen also shall mourn, and all who drop a hook into the Nile shall lament, and those who spread nets on the waters shall grow feeble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those who work in fine flax, and those who weave white cloth shall be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And her foundations shall be broken, and all who make wages shall be troubled in soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Surely the rulers of Zoan are fools; the counsel of the wise counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Where are they? Where are your wise men? And let them tell you now, and let them know what Jehovah of Hosts has advised against Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The rulers of Zoan have become fools, the rulers of Noph are deceived; they have also misled Egypt, the chief of her tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jehovah has mixed a perverse spirit in its midst; and they have caused Egypt to err in all its work, like a drunkard staggers in his vomit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Egypt shall have no work that the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In that day Egypt shall be like women; and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of Hosts, which He shakes over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt; everyone who mentions it shall be afraid in himself because of the counsel of Jehovah of Hosts which He has devised against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In that day five cities in the land of Egypt shall speak the language of Canaan and swear to Jehovah of Hosts; one shall be called the City of Destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Jehovah at its border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to Jehovah of Hosts in the land of Egypt. For they shall cry unto Jehovah because of the oppressors, and He shall send them a deliverer, even a great one, and shall deliver them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah shall be known to Egypt, and Egypt shall know Jehovah in that day, and shall offer sacrifice and offering; and they shall vow a vow unto Jehovah, and make good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehovah shall strike Egypt; He shall strike and heal; and they shall return to Jehovah, and He will be entreated by them and heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In that day there shall be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria shall come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, and Egypt shall serve with Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In that day Israel shall be one of three with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom Jehovah of Hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be My people Egypt, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
