The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of Jehovah and the majesty of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Make the weak hands strong, and make the feeble knees secure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Say to those of anxious heart, Be strong, fear not! Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God. He will come and save you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing. For in the wilderness waters shall break out, and streams in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land shall become springs of water, in the habitation of dragons where they dwell, a place for grass with reeds and rushes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And a highway shall be there, even a road; and it shall be called, The Way of Holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it. Whoever travels on it, though a fool, shall not go astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up on it; they shall not be found there. But only the redeemed shall walk there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy on their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
