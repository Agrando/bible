And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are swayed by the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Jehovah said to Isaiah, Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the highway to the Fullers Field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And say to him, Take care and be quiet. Do not fear, nor be softhearted because of the two tails of these smoking firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin from Syria, and of the son of Remaliah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted against you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let us go up against Judah and trouble it, and break through the wall for ourselves, and set a king in the midst of it, the son of Tabeel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, nor shall it come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken so that it shall not be a people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliahs son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Furthermore Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ask for a sign from Jehovah your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, nor will I tempt Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He said, Hear now, O house of David; is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Butter and honey He shall eat until He knows to refuse the evil and choose the good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For before the Child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you loathe shall be forsaken by both its kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jehovah shall bring upon you, and upon your people, and upon your fathers house, days that have not come since the days that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it shall come to pass in that day that Jehovah shall whistle for the fly at the ends of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they shall come, and all of them shall rest in the steep valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and on all the thorns, and on all the pastures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In the same day the Lord shall shave with a hired razor, with those beyond the River, with the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet, and it shall also snatch away the beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall be in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow and two sheep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>so it will be that, from the abundance of milk which they shall give, that He shall eat butter; for everyone who is left in the land shall eat butter and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines, worth a thousand pieces of silver, it shall even be for briers and thorns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>With arrows and with bows, men shall come there, because all the land shall become briers and thorns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all hills which were hoed with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be a place to turn the ox loose, and for sheep to trample.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
