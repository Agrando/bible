I had said, Look to Me, Look to Me; to a nation that was not calling upon My name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I have spread out My hands all the day to a rebellious people who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>a people who continually provoke Me to anger to My face; who sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense on altars of bricks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>who remain among the graves, and spend the night in the tombs, who eat swines flesh, and the broth of unclean things in their vessels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>who say, Keep to yourself, do not come near me; for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in My nose, a fire that burns all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, it is written before Me; I will not be silent, but what I will repay; yea, I will repay into their bosom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says Jehovah, who have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed Me on the hills. Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus says Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Do not destroy it, for a blessing is in it; so I will do to My servants, that I may not destroy them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one who inherits My mountains; and My elect shall inherit it, and My servants shall dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, for My people who have sought Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you are those who forsake Jehovah, who forget My holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who furnish the drink offering to Fate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I have assigned you to the sword; and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not hear, but did evil before My eyes, and chose that in which I have not delighted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, My servants will eat, but you shall be hungry. Behold, My servants will drink, but you shall be thirsty. Behold, My servants will rejoice, but you shall be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, My servants will sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl because of a crushed spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you shall leave your name as a curse to My elect; for the Lord Jehovah will kill you, and call His servants by another name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth. And he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from My eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth. And the former shall not be remembered, nor come to mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem as a rejoicing, and her people as a joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I have rejoiced in Jerusalem, and exulted in My people. And the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There shall not be an infant of only a few days, nor an old man that has not fulfilled his days. For the child shall die at a hundred years old; but the sinner who is a hundred years old shall be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they shall build houses and live in them; and they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They shall not build, and another live in them; they shall not plant, and another eat. For as the days of a tree are the days of My people, and My elect shall grow old enjoying the work of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth children for terror. For they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpents food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, says Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
