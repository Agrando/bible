It shall be like the shaking of an olive tree, and as gleanings of grapes when the vintage has been finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of Jehovah, they shall cry aloud from the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore glorify Jehovah in the light of the fire, the name of the Lord Jehovah of Israel from the seashores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>From the ends of the earth we have heard songs, glory to the righteous. But I said, Leanness to me! Leanness to me! Woe to me! Deceivers deceive, even with treachery. Deceivers deceive!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Terror and the pit and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it shall be that he who flees from the sound of terror shall fall into the pit. And he who comes up out of the midst of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For the windows from on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth quake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The earth has been badly broken! The earth is split open and cracked through! The earth has shaken greatly and is tottering!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Like a drunkard the earth is staggering back and forth! And it sways to and fro like a hut! Its transgressions have been heavy upon it; and it shall fall and not rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall come to pass in that day that Jehovah will punish the host of the haughty ones on high; and on earth, the kings of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they shall be gathered, as prisoners are gathered in a dungeon. And they shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days they shall be visited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the moon shall be abashed, and the sun shall be ashamed, when Jehovah of Hosts shall reign on Mount Zion, in Jerusalem, and before His elders, in splendor.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
