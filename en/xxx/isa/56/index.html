And do not let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus says Jehovah to the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths, and choose what pleases Me, and hold fast to My covenant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even to them will I give within My house and within My walls a share and a name better than that of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Also the children of the foreigner, who join themselves to Jehovah to serve Him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be His servants, everyone who keeps from defiling the Sabbath, and holds fast to My covenant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Even them I will bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer.
