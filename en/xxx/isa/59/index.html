They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They hatch vipers eggs and weave the spiders web; he who eats their eggs dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Their webs shall not become garments, nor shall they cover themselves with their works; their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; devastation and destruction are in their paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The way of peace they have not known, and there is no justice in their paths. They have made crooked paths for themselves; whoever goes in them shall not know peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore justice is far from us; nor does righteousness overtake us. We wait for daylight, but behold, the night; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes. We stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in desolate places like dead men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We all roar like bears, and mourn with moaning like doves; we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For our transgressions are multiplied before You, and our sins testify against us. For our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>in transgressing and lying against Jehovah, and backsliding from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And justice is driven back, and righteousness stands afar off; for truth has fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yea, truth fails; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased Him that there was no justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor. Therefore His own arm brought salvation unto Him; and His righteousness, it sustained Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on His head. And He put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was covered with zeal as a cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>According to their deeds, accordingly He will repay; fury to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies. He will completely repay their deeds to the coastlands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of Jehovah shall drive him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to those who turn from transgression in Jacob, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As for Me, this is My covenant with them, says Jehovah; My Spirit that is upon you, and My Words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seeds seed, says Jehovah, from now on and forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
