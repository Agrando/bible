I will pour My spirit upon your seed, and My blessing upon your offspring;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One shall say, I am JehovahÂ’s; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall write with his hand, For Jehovah, and be named by the name of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thus says Jehovah, the King of Israel, and His Redeemer Jehovah of Hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and besides Me there is no God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And who shall proclaim as I do, and shall declare it and set it in order for Me; since I founded the ancient people? And the things that are coming, and shall come; let them declare it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Fear not, nor be afraid; have I not told you and declared it since then? Thus, you are My witnesses. Is there a God besides Me? Yea, there is no other rock. I have not known any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Those who make a graven image, all of them are vanity; and the things which they desire shall not help. And they are their own witnesses; they do not see nor know; that they may be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who has formed a god or smelted a graven image that benefits nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, all his companions shall be ashamed; and the craftsmen, they are men. Let them be gathered together; let them stand up; they shall be in dread; they shall be ashamed together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The craftsman in iron makes it in the coals with the tongs, and fashions it with hammers, and makes it with the strength of his arms. Then, he is hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water, and is faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The craftsman in wood stretches a measuring line; he makes an outline with a marker; he works it with carving tools, and he marks it out with the compass, and makes it like the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, that it may remain in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He cuts down cedars, and takes cypress and oak, which he secures for himself among the trees of the forest. He plants a fir tree, and the rain makes it grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then it shall be for a man to burn; for he will take some of it and warm himself. Yes, he kindles it and bakes bread; he also makes a god and bows down to it; he makes it into a graven image and prostrates himself to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He burns part of it in the fire; with part of it he eats flesh; he roasts a roast and is satisfied; indeed, he warms himself, and says, Ah! I am warm, I have seen the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the rest of it he makes into a god, his graven image. He prostrates himself before it and bows down, and prays to it, and says, Deliver me! for you are my mighty god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They have not known nor understood; for He has shut their eyes so that they cannot see; and their hearts so that they cannot understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And no one considers within his heart, nor is there perception nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; indeed, also I have baked bread on its coals; I have roasted flesh and eaten; and shall I make the rest of it into an abomination? Shall I prostrate myself to a piece of wood?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He feeds on ashes; a deceived heart has turned him aside, so that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is this not a lie in my right hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for you are My servant; I have formed you; you are My servant; O Israel, you shall not be forgotten by Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and as a cloud, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Sing, O heavens; for Jehovah has done it! Shout, you lower parts of the earth! Break forth into singing, you mountains, O forest, and every tree in it! For Jehovah has redeemed Jacob, and glorified Himself in Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus says Jehovah, your Redeemer, and He who formed you from the womb: I am Jehovah, who makes all things, who stretches out the heavens alone, who spreads out the earth by Myself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who brings to nothing the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad; who turns the wise backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>who establishes the word of His servant, and performs the counsel of His messengers; who says to Jerusalem, You shall be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, You shall be built, and I will raise up its waste places;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>who says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>who says of Cyrus, He is My shepherd, and shall do all My pleasure; even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
