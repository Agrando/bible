I have put My Spirit upon Him; He shall bring forth justice to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He shall not cry out, nor lift up, nor cause His voice to be heard in the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A bruised reed He shall not break, and a smoking wick He shall not quench; He shall bring forth justice unto truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He shall not fail nor be discouraged, until He has established justice on the earth; and the islands shall wait for His Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says Jehovah the Mighty God, He who created the heavens and stretched them out, spreading out the earth and its offspring; Who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I, Jehovah, have called You in righteousness, and will hold Your hand, and will keep You, and give You as a covenant to the people, as a Light to the nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, those who sit in darkness out of the prison house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am Jehovah; that is My name; and My glory I will not give to another, nor My praise to graven images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I declare; before they spring forth, I proclaim them to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Sing to Jehovah a new song; His praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it; the coastlands and its inhabitants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voice, the villages where Kedar dwells. Let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the mountain tops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Give glory to Jehovah and declare His praise in the coastlands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehovah goes forth as a mighty man, He stirs up zeal like a man of war; He shouts, yea, roars; He shows Himself mighty against His enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have continually kept silent; I have been still and refrained Myself. Now I will cry like a woman in labor; I will pant and gasp at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will make waste the mountains and hills, and dry up all their vegetation. And I will make the rivers coastlands, and I will dry up the pools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths they have not known; I will make darkness into light before them, and crooked places straight. I will do these things for them, and not forsake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They have been turned back, they are greatly ashamed, those who trust in graven images and who say to the molten images, You are our gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hear, you deaf; and look, you blind, that you may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who is blind but My servant? Or deaf, as My messenger whom I sent? Who is blind as he who is perfect, and blind as Jehovahs servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You see many things, but do not observe; opening the ears, but no one hears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehovah is well pleased for His righteousness sake; He will magnify the Law and make it honorable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But this is a people robbed and plundered; all of them are snared in holes, and they are hidden in prison houses. They are as prey, and no one delivers them; spoils, and no one says, Give it back!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who among you will give ear to this? Who will listen and hear for the time to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who gave Jacob for a spoils, and Israel to robbers? Was it not Jehovah, against whom we have sinned? For they would not walk in His ways, nor did they obey His Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore He has poured upon him the fury of His anger, and the strength of battle. And it has set him on fire all around, yet he did not know; and it burned him, yet he did not lay it to heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
