The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink; they are swallowed up by wine; they have gone astray through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For all tables are full of vomit and excrement; no place is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>To whom shall He teach knowledge? And whom shall He make to understand the message? Those weaned from the milk and removed from the breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for with stammering lips and another tongue He will speak to this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To whom He said, This is the rest; cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing. Yet they were not willing to hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the Word of Jehovah was to them, Precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little; that they might go and fall backward, and be broken and snared and caught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore hear the Word of Jehovah, you scornful men who rule this people in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because you have said, We have made a covenant with death, and we have made an agreement with Sheol; when the overflowing scourge shall have gone and passed through, it shall not come upon us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I have founded in Zion a Stone, a tried Stone, a precious Cornerstone, a sure Foundation; he who trusts in It shall not be anxious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And your covenant with death shall be covered over, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand; when the overwhelming scourge shall pass through, then you shall be trampled down by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From the time that it goes out it shall take you; for morning by morning it shall pass over, by day and by night; and it shall be a terror just to understand the report.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the cover is too narrow to wrap oneself in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Jehovah shall rise up as at Mount Perazim; He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon, so that He may do His deeds, His strange deeds; and bring to pass His works, His unusual works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So then do not be mockers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of Hosts that an annihilation is decreed upon the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Give ear and hear my voice; listen, and hear my speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Does the plowman plow all day to sow? Does he loosen and harrow his ground?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When he has leveled its surface, does he not scatter the black cumin and sprinkle the cumin, and plant the wheat in rows and mark off the barley and spelt in their boundaries?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For God instructs him to do right; and teaches him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the black cumin is not threshed with a threshing instrument, nor is a cart wheel turned on cumin; but the black cumin is beaten out with a stick and the cumin with a rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Bread flour is ground. But one does not continue treading and threshing it; nor does he destroy it with his cart wheel; nor pulverize it with his horse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This also comes forth from Jehovah of Hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excels in sound wisdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
