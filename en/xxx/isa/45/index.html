And I will loosen the loins of kings, to open before him the gates; and the gates shall not be shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will go before you, and make the high places level and straight. I will break in pieces the gates of bronze, and cut the iron bars in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I, Jehovah, who calls you by your name, am the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For Jacob My servantÂ’s sake, and Israel My elect, I have even proclaimed your name; I have entitled you, though you have not known Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am Jehovah, and there is none other, no God besides Me; I embraced you, though you have not known Me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that they may know from the rising of the sun, to its setting, that there is none besides Me. I am Jehovah, and there is no other;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>forming the light and creating darkness; making peace and creating evil. I, Jehovah, do all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Rain down from above, O heavens, and let the clouds pour down righteousness. Let the earth open, and let salvation bear fruit; and let righteousness spring up together. I, Jehovah, have created it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Woe to him who strives with the One who formed him, a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to the one who forms it, What are you making? Or your work, He has no hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Woe to him who says to his father, What are you begetting? Or to the woman, What are you writhing over?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus says Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and the One who formed him, Do you ask Me of things to come? Do you give command to Me about My sons, and about the work of My hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have made the earth, and created man on it; I, with My hands, have stretched out the heavens; and all their host have I ordained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways; he shall build My city, and he shall set free My captives, not for price nor reward, says Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus says Jehovah, The labor of Egypt, and merchandise of Cush, and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come to you, and they shall be yours. They shall follow behind you; and they shall pass over in chains and they shall bow down to you. They shall plead with you, saying, Surely the Mighty God is in you; there is no one else, no other God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly You are a Mighty God who hides Yourself, O God of Israel, the Savior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them; they who are makers of idols shall go into disgrace together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Israel shall be saved in Jehovah with an everlasting salvation. You shall not be ashamed nor humiliated to everlasting eternity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus says Jehovah who Created the heavens, God who has formed the earth and made it; who has established it, who has not created it void, but has formed it to be inhabited: I am Jehovah, and there is no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth. I did not say to the seed of Jacob, Seek me in vain. I, Jehovah, speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you who have escaped from the nations. Those who set up the wood of their graven image, and those that pray to a god that cannot save, they know nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Declare and approach; yea, let them take counsel together. Who has declared this from antiquity? Who has told it since then? Is it not I, Jehovah. And there is no other God besides Me; a just Mighty God and a Savior; there is no one besides Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Turn to Me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am the Mighty God, and there is no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I have sworn by Myself, the word has gone out of My mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>One shall say, Only in Jehovah do I have righteousness and strength; to Him men shall come. And they shall be ashamed, all who are angry with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
