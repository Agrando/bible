To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Without Me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. In all this His hand is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger! And the staff in their hand is My indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the people of My wrath. I will command him to draw out the plunder, and to seize the spoils, and to trample them like the mud of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet he does not plan this, nor does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off not a few nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he says, Are not my commanders all like kings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images excelled those of Jerusalem and Samaria;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass, when the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, that He will say, I will punish the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his haughty looks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he says, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am discerning. And I have removed the borders of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And my hand has found, as a nest, the riches of the people; and as one gathers eggs that are left, I have gathered all the earth; and there was no one who moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shall the ax boast itself against him who chops with it? Shall the saw magnify itself against him who moves it? As if the rod could swing itself at those who lift it up! As if a staff could rise up, as though it were not wood!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, shall send leanness among his fat ones; and under his glory He shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the light of Israel shall be as a fire, and His Holy One as a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it shall burn up the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, both soul and body; and they shall be as when a sick one faints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be so few, that a child might write them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob, shall never again lean on him who struck them; but will truly lean on Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, to the Strong and Mighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though Your people Israel are like the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return; the completion which is decreed shall overflow with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the Lord Jehovah of Hosts shall make a full end, as ordained, in the midst of all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, O my people who dwell in Zion, do not fear Assyria. He shall strike you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, in the way of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But yet a little while, and the indignation shall cease, and My anger shall be for their destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jehovah of Hosts shall stir up a scourge upon him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and as His staff was on the sea, so shall He lift it up in the way of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He has come to Aiath, he has passed to Migron; at Michmash he has stored his equipment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>they have gone over the pass; they have taken lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid, Gibeah of Saul has fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim; cause it to be heard unto Laish; O poor Anathoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Madmenah has fled; the inhabitants of Gebim seek refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet he shall remain at Nob that day; he shall shake his fist against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, shall lop off the bough with terror; and those exalted high shall be chopped down, and the haughty shall be humbled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And He shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by the Mighty One.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
