For afterwards He will glorify the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them the light has shined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You have multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy. They rejoice before You according to the joy at harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For You have broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his taskmaster, as in the day of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For every trembling boot of the warrior, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be fuel for burning in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The Strong and Mighty God, The Eternal Father, The Prince of Peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of the increase of His government and peace upon the throne of David there will be no end; and upon His kingdom, to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from now on, even forever. The zeal of Jehovah of Hosts will accomplish this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Lord sent a Word to Jacob, and it has fallen upon Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And all the people shall know; Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and insolence of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The bricks have fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will use cedars instead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore Jehovah shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and spur his enemies on;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the Syrians in front and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the people do not turn to Him who strikes them, nor do they seek Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and bulrush, in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The elder and honorable, he is the head; and the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the leaders of this people lead them astray; and those who are led by them are swallowed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore the Lord shall not rejoice over their young men, nor shall He have mercy on their orphans and widows; for everyone is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks foolishness. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For wickedness burns like the fire; it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall billow up in a column of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Through the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts the land is scorched, and the people shall be as fuel for the fire; no man shall have compassion on his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he shall cut off on the right hand and be hungry; and he shall devour on the left, and they shall not be satisfied. Each man shall eat the flesh of his own arm;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and together they shall be against Judah. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
