Then I said, Here am I! Send me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said, Go, and tell this people, You listen to hear, but do not understand; you look to see, but do not perceive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn back, and be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I said, Lord, how long? And He answered, Until the cities have been smashed to ruins without inhabitant, and the houses without a man, and the land is left devastated,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and until Jehovah has sent the men far away, and the desolation in the midst of the land is great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return and be consumed like the terebinth and like the oak when it is cut down, whose stump remains. The holy seed is its stump.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
