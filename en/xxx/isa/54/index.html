For more are the children of the desolate than the children of the one who is married, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings. Do not spare, lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>for you shall burst forth on the right hand and on the left. And your seed shall inherit the nations, and make the desolate cities inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Do not fear, for you shall not be ashamed; nor be humiliated, for you shall not be put to shame. For you shall forget the shame of your youth, and shall not remember the reproach of your widowhood any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For your Maker is your husband; Jehovah of Hosts is His name; and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. He shall be called, GOD OF THE WHOLE EARTH.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For Jehovah has called you as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, like a wife of youth, when you were rejected, says your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For a brief moment I have left you; but with great mercies I will gather you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In overflowing wrath I hid My face from you for a moment; but with everlasting kindness I will have mercy upon you, says Jehovah your Redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this is like the waters of Noah to Me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should never again overflow the earth, so I have sworn to not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed, but My kindness shall not depart from you, nor shall My covenant of peace be removed, says Jehovah, who has mercy on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>O you afflicted one, storm-tossed and not comforted, behold, I will lay your stones with colorful gems, and lay your foundations with sapphires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will make your pinnacles of ruby, and your gates of sparkling stones, and all your borders of delightful stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all your children shall be taught of Jehovah, and great shall be the peace of your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In righteousness you shall be established; you shall be far from oppression; for you shall not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Indeed, they shall surely gather together, but not by Me; whoever shall gather against you, by you he shall fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I have created the smith who blows the coals in the fire, and who brings out a tool for his work; and I have created the one who ruins to destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment, you shall condemn. This is the inheritance of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness is from Me, says Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
