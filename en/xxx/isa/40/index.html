And he said, What shall I proclaim? All flesh is grass, and all the goodness of it is as the flower of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The grass withers, the flower fades, because the Spirit of Jehovah blows upon it; surely the people are grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The grass withers, the flower fades; but the Word of our God stands forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You, who brings good tidings to Zion, go up onto the high mountain. Lift up your voice with strength, you who brings good tidings to Jerusalem, lift it up, be not afraid. Say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come with a strong hand, and His arm shall rule for Him; behold, His reward is with Him, and His work before Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He shall feed His flock like a shepherd; He shall gather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom, and shall gently lead those who are with young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and measured out the heavens with a span? And who has calculated the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who has directed the Spirit of Jehovah, and what man, as a counselor, has taught Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With whom did He take counsel, and who instructed Him and taught Him in the path of justice; and taught Him knowledge, and made known the way of understanding to Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, and are counted as the fine dust on the scales; behold, He lifts up the islands as a very little thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Lebanon is not enough to burn, nor the beasts of it enough for a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All the nations before Him are as nothing; and to Him they are accounted as less than nothing, and vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To whom then will you compare the Mighty God? Or what likeness will you compare to Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The workman casts a graven image, and the goldsmith spreads it over with gold, and smelts silver chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Whoever is too poor for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot; he looks for a skillful workman to prepare a graven image that will not totter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is He who sits upon the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who brings the rulers to nothing; He makes the judges of the earth as nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Indeed, they shall not be planted; indeed, they shall not be sown. Indeed, their stump shall not take root in the earth. And He shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the tempest shall take them away like stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To whom then will you compare Me, or with whom am I equal? says the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Lift up your eyes on high, and consider who has created these things, who brings out their host by number. He calls them all by name by the greatness of His might, for He is strong in power; not one is missing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hidden from Jehovah and my judgment is passed over by God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Have you not known? Have you not heard, that the eternal God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not grow faint nor weary? His understanding is unsearchable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He gives power to the faint; and to him with no strength, He increases might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even the young shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall be feeble and stumble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but those who wait upon Jehovah shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
