Yes, the fire of Your enemies shall devour them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jehovah, You will establish peace for us; for You have also done all our works in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O Jehovah our God, masters besides You have had the rule over us; but by You only will we make mention of Your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Those who are dead do not live; spirits of the dead do not rise. Therefore You have punished and destroyed them, and made all memory of them to perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You have increased the nation, O Jehovah, You have increased the nation; You are glorified; You have extended it to the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jehovah, in trouble they have visited You; they have poured out a prayer when Your chastening was upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As a woman with child draws near to giving birth, she writhes and cries out in her pangs; so have we been in Your sight, O Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We have conceived; we have writhed in pain; but we have given birth (as it were) to wind. We have not produced any salvation in the earth; nor have the inhabitants of the world fallen out in birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your dead ones shall live, together with My dead body they shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; for your dew is as the dew of the light, and the earth shall cast out the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Come, my people, enter into your rooms and shut your doors behind you; hide (as it were) for a few moments, until the indignation has passed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For behold, Jehovah comes out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
