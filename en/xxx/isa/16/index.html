You shall mourn for the foundations of Kir-hareseth; surely they are stricken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have beat down its choice plants which have come to Jazer, and wandered in the wilderness; her branches are stretched out, they have crossed over the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I will bewail the vine of Sibmah with the weeping of Jazer. I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for the shouting for your summer fruits and your harvest has fallen short.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Gladness and joy are removed out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there is no singing and no shouting. The treader shall tread out no wine in the presses; I have made their shouting to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore my stomach shall growl like a harp for Moab, and my inner being for Kir-heres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not have enough strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is the Word which Jehovah has spoken to Moab since that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But now Jehovah has spoken, saying, Within three years, like the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be disgraced with all that great multitude; and the little remnant shall be few, not mighty.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
