I acted suddenly, and they came to pass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew and your brow bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I even declared it to you from the beginning. Before it happened I proclaimed it to you, lest you should say, My idol has done them, and my graven image and my molten image has commanded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have heard; see all this. And will you not declare it? I have shown you new things from this time, even hidden things, and you did not know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are created now, and not since the beginning; even before the day when you did not hear them; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Surely you did not hear, surely you did not know; surely from long ago your ear was not opened. For I knew that you would deceive with treachery, and were called a transgressor from the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For My nameÂ’s sake I will prolong My anger, and for My praise I will restrain for you, so that I do not cut you off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For my own sake, for My own sake I will do it; for why should My name be defiled? And I will not give My glory to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Listen to me O Jacob, and Israel My called; I am He; I am the first, I also am the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has stretched out the heavens. When I called to them, they stood up together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let all of you gather and hear. Who among them has declared these things? Jehovah has loved him; He will do as He pleases upon Babylon, and His arm shall be upon the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought him and made his way prosperous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come near to Me, hear this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning. From the time it existed, I was there; and now the Lord Jehovah, and His Spirit, has sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Jehovah your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way that you should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Oh that you had paid attention to My commandments! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your seed also would have been like the sand, and the offspring of your womb like grains of sand; his name would not have been cut off nor destroyed from before My face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go out from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! Declare it with a resounding voice! Proclaim this; let it go forth to the ends of the earth! Say, Jehovah has redeemed His servant, Jacob!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they did not thirst when He led them through the deserts; He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; He split open the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no peace, says Jehovah, unto the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
