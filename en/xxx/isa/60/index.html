All of them gather themselves; they come to you. Your sons shall come from afar, and your daughters shall be carried on the side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then you shall be in awe and become radiant, and your heart shall tremble and swell for joy; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A multitude of camels shall overwhelm you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah. All those from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you; the rams of Nebajoth shall minister to you. They shall come up on My altar and be acceptable to Me, and I will glorify the house of My glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who are these who fly like a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Surely the coastlands shall wait for Me, and the ships of Tarshish will come first, to bring your children from afar, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of Jehovah your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because He has glorified you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the sons of foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall serve you; for in My wrath I struck you, but in My favor I have had mercy upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore your gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day or night, to bring to you the wealth of the nations, and that their kings may be led.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish. Yes, those nations will be wasted unto desolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; and I will make the place of My feet glorious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Also the sons of those who afflicted you shall come bowing to you; and all those who despised you shall prostrate themselves at the soles of your feet. And they shall call you, The City of Jehovah, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whereas you were forsaken and hated, so that no one passed through, I will make you a perpetual majesty, a joy of many generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You shall also suck the milk of the nations, and suckle the breast of kings; and you shall know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Instead of bronze I will bring gold, and instead of iron I will bring silver; and instead of wood I will bring bronze, and instead of stones, iron. I will also make your officers peace, and your overseers righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Violence shall no more be heard in your land, neither devastation nor destruction within your borders; but you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The sun shall no more be your light by day; nor the brightness of the moon give light to you; but Jehovah will be to you an everlasting light, and your God your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Your sun shall not go down any more, nor shall your moon withdraw itself; for Jehovah will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning shall be ended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Your people also shall all be righteous; they shall inherit the land forever, the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, so that I may be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I, Jehovah, will hasten it in its time.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
