(which means, Hurry to the plunder! Make haste to the spoils!)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And I took to myself faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I went in to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then Jehovah said to me, Call his name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jehovah also spoke to me again saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliahs son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>therefore behold, the Lord brings up upon them the waters of the River, strong and abundant, even the king of Assyria and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he shall pass through Judah. He shall overflow and go over; he shall reach to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Suffer evil, O people, and be broken! Give ear, all you from distant lands. Gird yourselves and be broken. Gird yourselves and be broken!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take counsel and make plans, but they will be frustrated. Speak a word, but it shall not stand; for the Mighty God is with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For Jehovah spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and warned me against walking in the way of this people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Do not say, A conspiracy! to everything which this people calls, A conspiracy! And do not be afraid with their fear, nor be terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sanctify Jehovah of Hosts Himself, and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He shall be a sanctuary for you; but a stone of stumbling, and a rock of falling to both the houses of Israel; and a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Bind up the testimony, seal the Law among My disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will wait on Jehovah, who hides His face from the house of Jacob; and I will watch for Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah has given me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel, from Jehovah of Hosts who dwells in Mount Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when they say to you, Consult the sorcerers and fortunetellers who peep and mutter; should not a people inquire of their God, rather than the living of the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To the Law and to the Testimony! If they do not speak according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they shall pass through it, hard-pressed and hungry; and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry, that they shall be enraged and curse their king and their God, and look upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they shall look to the land; and behold, trouble and darkness and gloom of anguish! And they shall be thrust into darkness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
