Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba; baldness shall be on all their heads, and every beard cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In the streets they shall clothe themselves with sackcloth; on the tops of their houses and in their streets everyone shall howl, weeping bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Heshbon and Elealeh shall cry for help; their voice shall be heard as far as Jahaz.
