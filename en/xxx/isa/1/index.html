For Jehovah has spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, but they have rebelled against Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The ox knows his owner, and the ass his masterÂ’s manger, but Israel does not know; My people have not discerned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Woe, sinful nation, a people heavy with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children who corrupt! They have forsaken Jehovah; they have scorned the Holy One of Israel. They are estranged backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why will you be stricken any more? Will you rebel more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it; only wounds and bruises and fresh stripes; they have not been closed nor bound up, nor has it been softened with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your land is a desolation; your cities burned with fire. Strangers devour your land before you; and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Except Jehovah of Hosts had left us a small remnant, we would be as Sodom; we would be as Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the Word of Jehovah, you rulers of Sodom. Give heed to the Law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>What good to Me are your many sacrifices, says Jehovah? I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of well-fed cattle; nor do I delight in the blood of bulls, of lambs, or he goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Bring no more vain sacrifices; its incense is an abomination to Me. I cannot endure the new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies, and the wicked festivals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My soul hates your new moons and your appointed feasts. They are a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you. Even though you multiply prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wash yourselves, purify yourselves. Put away the evil of your doings from My eyes; stop doing evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Learn to do good, seek justice, set straight the oppressor, judge for the orphan, plead for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come now and let us reason together, says Jehovah: Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Oh how the faithful city has become a harlot! It was full of justice; righteousness lodged in it; but now, murderers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Your silver has become dross; your wine is diluted with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Your rulers are rebellious and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe, and pursues rewards. They do not judge for the orphan, nor does the cause of the widow come before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore says the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah! I will be eased of My adversaries, and avenge Myself of My enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will turn back My hand upon you, and refine your dross, as with lye, and remove all your alloy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will return your judges as at the first; and your advisers, as at the beginning; then you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her returning ones with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together. And those who forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they shall be ashamed of the mighty trees which you desired; and you shall be ashamed of the gardens that you have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For you shall be like a mighty tree whose leaf fades, and like a garden that has no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the strong shall be as tinder, and the work as a spark; and they both shall burn together; and no one shall quench them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
