What ails you now, that you have gone up to the housetops?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The noisy city, the joyous city, is filled with turbulence. Your slain ones are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>All your rulers have fled together; they have been captured without the bow; all who are found in you have been captured together; they have fled from afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore I said, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly; do not insist on comforting me because of the devastation of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For it is a day of trouble, and of trampling down, and of perplexity by Jehovah of Hosts in the Valley of Vision; of breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Elam carried the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it shall come to pass that your choicest valleys shall be full of chariots; and the horsemen shall surely be set in array at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he uncovered Judahs covering, and you looked in that day to the armor of the House of the Forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You have also seen the breaks in the city of David, that they are many; and you gathered the waters of the lower pool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you have counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you have broken down the houses to fortify the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool; but you have not looked to its Maker, nor had regard for Him who formed it long ago.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in that day Jehovah of Hosts called for weeping and mourning, and for baldness, and for girding with sackcloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But behold, joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine, saying, Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it was revealed in my ears by Jehovah of Hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be atoned until you die, says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, Depart, go to this steward, to Shebna who is over the house, and say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>What have you here? And who is here with you, that you have hewn out a tomb for yourself here, as one who proudly hews for himself a tomb, who carves out a dwelling place for himself in a rock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, Jehovah will cast you away into captivity, O mighty man, and will grasp and wrap you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He will wind up and whirl you like a ball into a large land; there you shall die, and there the chariots of your glory shall be the shame of your masters house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will drive you from your position, and he will tear you down from your station.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in that day it shall be that I will call My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and I will clothe him with your robe, and will strengthen him with your sash, and I will entrust your rule into his hand. And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the key of the house of David I will lay on his shoulder; so he shall open, and no one shall shut; and he shall shut, and no one shall open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will fasten him as a peg in a firm place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they shall hang on him all the glory of his fathers house, the offspring and the offshoots, all insignificant vessels, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of jars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In that day, says Jehovah of Hosts, the peg that is fastened in the firm place shall be removed, and be cut down and fall. And the burden that was on it shall be cut off; for Jehovah has spoken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
