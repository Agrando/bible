A tumultuous sound of the kingdoms of nations gathered together! Jehovah of Hosts musters the army for battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They come from a distant land, from the ends of the heavens; Jehovah and the weapons of His indignation, to destroy the whole land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Howl! For the day of Jehovah is at hand! It shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore all hands shall be faint, and every manÂ’s heart shall melt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and they shall be afraid. Pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them. They shall writhe like a woman giving birth. They shall be amazed at one another; their faces like flames.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, the day of Jehovah comes, cruel and with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land waste; and He shall destroy its sinners out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the stars of the heavens and their constellations shall not give light; the sun shall be darkened in its going forth, and the moon shall not shine its light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. And I will put an end to the arrogance of the proud, and will lay low the haughtiness of the tyrants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will make mortal man more precious than refined gold; even mankind than the pure gold of Ophir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall move out of its place, in the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts, and in the day of His fierce anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it shall be as a hunted gazelle, and as a sheep that no man takes up; each man shall turn to his own people, and everyone flee into his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Everyone who is found shall be thrust through; and everyone who is captured shall fall by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Their children shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be plundered, and their wives ravished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who shall not value silver; and they shall not delight in gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Their bows shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the majestic beauty of Chaldea, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It shall nevermore be inhabited, nor shall it be lived in from generation to generation; nor shall the Arabian pitch his tent there; nor shall the shepherds make their flocks lie down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of howling creatures; and young owls shall dwell there, and wild goats shall skip about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And howling beasts shall respond from desolate places, and dragons in the delightful palaces. Indeed, her time will soon come to pass, and her days shall not be prolonged.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
