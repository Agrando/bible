Or to which of My creditors have I sold you? Behold, you have been sold for your iniquities, and your mother has been put away for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Why, when I came, was no one here? I called and no one answered. Is My hand shortened at all so that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness; their fish stink, because there is no water, and die of thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord Jehovah has given Me the tongue of the learned, to know how to speak a word in season to the weary. He wakens morning by morning, He wakens the ear to hear as the learned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Lord Jehovah has opened My ear, and I was not rebellious, nor turned away backwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I gave My back to those who strike, and My cheeks to those who pluck; I hid not My face from shame and spitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the Lord Jehovah will help Me; therefore I have not been ashamed. Therefore I have set My face like flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He is near who justifies Me; who will contend with Me? Let us stand together; who is the master of My judgment? Let him come near Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help Me; who is he who shall condemn Me? Lo, they all shall wear out like a garment; the moth shall eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who among you fears Jehovah? Who obeys the voice of His Servant? Who walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah and rest on his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who are surrounded with sparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks which you have kindled. This you shall have from My hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
