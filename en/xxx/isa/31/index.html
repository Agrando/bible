When Jehovah shall stretch out His hand, both he who helps shall fall, and he who is helped shall fall down, and they shall all be finished together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus has Jehovah spoken to me: As the lion roars, and the young lion over his prey when a multitude of shepherds are summoned against him (he will not be afraid of their voice, nor fret himself because of their noise), so Jehovah of Hosts shall come down to fight for Mount Zion, and for its hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As birds flying, so Jehovah of Hosts will defend Jerusalem; also defending, He will deliver it; and passing over He will preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Return to Him, against whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For in that day every man shall reject his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you, a sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Assyria shall fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword, not of mankind, shall devour him. For he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become forced labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he shall pass over to his stronghold for fear, and his rulers shall be afraid of the banner, says Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
