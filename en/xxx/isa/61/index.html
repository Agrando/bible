And they shall repair the waste cities, what lay desolate for many generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you shall be named, The Priests of Jehovah; and they shall call you, Ministers of our God.
