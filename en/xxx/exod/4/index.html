He said, A staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He said, Throw it on the ground. So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled before it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand and take it by the tail; and he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that they may believe that Jehovah the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Furthermore Jehovah said to him, Now put your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, like snow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And He said, Put your hand back into your bosom. So he put his hand back into his bosom, and drew it out of his bosom, and behold, it was restored like his other flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall come to pass when they do not believe, nor heed the voice of the first sign, that perhaps they will believe the voice of the subsequent sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall come to pass when they do not believe even these two signs, nor listen to your voice, that you shall take water from the river and pour it on the dry land. And the water which you take from the river shall become blood on the dry land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses said to Jehovah, O my Lord, I am not a man of words, neither formerly in times past nor since You have spoken to Your servant; but I have a heavy mouth and a dull tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah said to him, Who has made manÂ’s mouth? Or who makes the mute, the deaf, the seeing, or the blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now therefore, go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said, O my Lord, please send by the hand of whomever You may send.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the anger of Jehovah burned against Moses, and He said: Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can form words to speak. And behold, he is also coming out to meet you; and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth. And I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he shall speak for you to the people. And he shall be as a mouth for you, and you shall be to him as God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you shall take this staff in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Please let me go and return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go, return to Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Moses took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, When you go back to Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in your hand. And I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah: Israel is My son, My firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I say unto you, Let My son go that he may serve Me. And if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass on the way, at the lodging place, that Jehovah met him and sought to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Zipporah took a flint and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely you are a husband of blood to me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So He let him go. Then she said, You are a husband of blood; because of the circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. So he went and met him on the mountain of God, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah who had sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken to Moses. And he did the signs in the eyes of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the people believed. And when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel and that He had given attention to their affliction, they bowed down and prostrated themselves.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
