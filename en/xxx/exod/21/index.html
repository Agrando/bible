He shall also bring him to the door, or to the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if a man sells his daughter to be a female slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If she is disagreeable to the eye of her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no power to sell her to a foreign people, since he has dealt deceitfully with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if he has betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her according to the manner of daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If he takes another wife, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, and her conjugal rights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if he does not do these three for her, then she shall go out free, without money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who strikes a man so that he dies shall be executed to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, if he did not lie in wait, but God allowed the meeting into his hand, then I will appoint for you a place where he may flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if a man comes presumptuously against his neighbor, to kill him by deceit, you shall take him even from My altar, that he may die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he who strikes his father or his mother shall be executed to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who steals a man and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, shall be executed to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he who curses his father or his mother shall be executed to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If men strive with each other, and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist, and he does not die but is confined to his bed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>if he rises again and walks about outside with his staff, then he who struck him shall be acquitted. He shall only pay for the loss of his time, and shall provide for him to be healed of his injuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if a man beats his male or female servant with a rod, so that he dies under his hand, vengeance shall be taken to avenge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nevertheless, if he continues a day or two, vengeance shall not be taken; for he is part of his assets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If men fight, and strike a pregnant woman, so that the child comes forth, without harm, he shall be punished to pay a fine as the womans husband imposes upon him; and he shall pay according to the assessment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if there is harm, then you shall requite soul for soul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If a man strikes the eye of his male or female servant, and destroys it, he shall let him go free in exchange for his eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if he knocks out the tooth of his male or female servant, he shall let him go free for his tooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, then the ox shall be stoned to death with stones, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be acquitted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But if the ox tended to thrust with its horn in times past, and the owner has been given warning, and he has not kept it restrained, so that it has killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If a ransom is imposed upon him, then he shall pay to redeem his life, whatever is imposed upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Whether it has gored a son or gored a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If the ox gores a male or female servant, he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if a man opens a pit, or if a man digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the owner of the pit shall make compensation; he shall give money to the owner, and the dead animal shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If one mans ox strikes against the ox of his neighbor, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide the money; and the dead ox they shall also divide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Or if it was known that the ox tended to thrust in time past, and its owner has not kept it restrained, he shall make compensation to pay, ox for ox, and the dead shall be his.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
