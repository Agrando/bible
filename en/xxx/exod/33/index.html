I should come up into your midst in one moment and consume you. Now therefore, take off your ornaments, that I may know what to do with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by Mount Horeb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses took the tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the tent of meeting. And it came to pass that everyone who sought Jehovah went out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass, whenever Moses went out to the tent, that all the people rose, and each man stood at his tent door and watched Moses until he had gone into the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass, when Moses entered the tent, that the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tent, and spoke with Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the door of the tent, and all the people arose and prostrated themselves, each man at the opening of his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he would return to the camp, and his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Moses said unto Jehovah, Consider how You say to me, Bring up this people. But You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, I know you by name, and you have also found favor in My eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now therefore, I pray, if I have found favor in Your eyes, show me now Your way, that I may know You and that I may find favor in Your eyes. And consider that this nation is Your people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He said, My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said unto Him, If Your Presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For how then will it be known that Your people and I have found favor in Your eyes, except You go with us? So we shall be distinct, Your people and I, from all the people who are upon the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will also do this thing that you have spoken; for you have found favor in My eyes, and I know you by name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Please, let me see Your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And He said, I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of Jehovah before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But He said, You are not able to see My face; for no man shall see Me, and live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah said, Here is a place by Me, and you shall stand on the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So it shall be, while My glory passes by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock, and will cover you with My hand while I pass by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
