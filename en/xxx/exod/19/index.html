And Israel camped there before the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah called to him from the mountain, saying, Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles wings and brought you unto Myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now therefore, if you will listen to obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak unto the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses came and summoned the elders of the people, and laid before them all these words which Jehovah had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the people answered together and said, All that Jehovah has spoken we will do. So Moses brought back the words of the people unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, I am coming to you in the thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever. And Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And let them be ready for the third day. For on the third day Jehovah will come down upon Mount Sinai in the eyes of all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, Take heed to yourselves that you do not go up to the mountain nor touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be executed to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Not a hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned with stones or shot with an arrow; whether man or beast, he shall not live. When the rams horn sounds long, they shall go up to the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day; do not approach your wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass on the third day, in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain; and the sound of the shofar was very loud, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Mount Sinai was completely in smoke, because Jehovah had descended upon it in fire. Its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the sound of the shofar continued its sound and became exceedingly loud, Moses spoke, and God answered him by voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain. And Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Go down and warn the people, that they not break through to gaze at Jehovah, and many of them be attacked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let the priests who come near Jehovah sanctify themselves, that Jehovah not break forth against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses said to Jehovah, The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai; for You have warned us, saying, Set bounds around the mountain and consecrate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jehovah said to him, Away! Go down and then come up, you and Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to Jehovah, lest He break forth against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
