You may take it from the sheep or from the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month. Then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it within the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they shall take some of the blood and put it upon the two doorposts and upon the lintel of the houses where they eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they shall eat the flesh in that night; roasted with fire, with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not eat it raw, nor cooked with boiling in water, but roasted with fire; its head with its legs and its entrails.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall let none of it remain until morning; and whatever remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And thus you shall eat it: with your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste. It is Passover unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment. I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the blood shall be a sign unto you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this day shall be to you a memorial; and you shall keep it as a feast unto Jehovah throughout your generations. You shall keep it as a feast by a perpetual ordinance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses. For whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>On the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation for you. No manner of work shall be done on them; except for each soul for eating; that only may be done by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you shall observe Unleavened Bread, for on this same day I have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a perpetual ordinance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month, at evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses, for whoever eats what is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a sojourner or a native of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, Draw out and take lambs for yourselves according to your families, and kill the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and apply the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin. And none of you shall go out of the door of his house until morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For Jehovah will pass through to strike Egypt; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, Jehovah will pass over the door and not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to strike you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And you shall observe this matter as an ordinance for you and your sons perpetually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it shall come to pass when you come to the land which Jehovah shall give you, just as He promised, that you shall keep this service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it shall be, when your children say to you, What do you mean by this service?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that you shall say, It is the Passover sacrifice of Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He struck Egypt and delivered our houses. So the people bowed down and prostrated themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the sons of Israel departed and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron; so they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass at midnight that Jehovah struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the prison house, and every firstborn of livestock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Pharaoh arose in the night, he, all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great outcry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one who died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he summoned Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Arise, go out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel. And go, serve Jehovah as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Also take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Egyptians prevailed upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste. For they thought, We shall all die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the people took their dough before it was leavened, having their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, and they asked from the Egyptians articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jehovah had given the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that they granted their requests. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And a mixed multitude also went up with them, and flocks and herds; exceedingly many cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they baked unleavened cakes from the dough which they had brought out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared food for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now the time the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt remained there was four hundred and thirty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, on the same day it came to pass, that all the armies of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>It is a night of observance unto Jehovah for bringing them out of the land of Egypt. This is that night of Jehovah, an observance for all the children of Israel throughout their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the Passover: No son of a foreigner shall eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But every mans servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then he may eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry any of the flesh outside the house, nor shall you break any of its bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>All the congregation of Israel shall observe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when a sojourner stays with you and wishes to keep the Passover unto Jehovah, let every male of his be circumcised, and then let him draw near to observe it; and he shall be as a native of the land. For no uncircumcised person shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>One law shall be for the native, and for the sojourner who stays among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Thus all the children of Israel did; as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass on the same day, that Jehovah brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt according to their armies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
