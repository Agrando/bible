Its horns shall be from the same piece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And you shall overlay its top, its sides all around, and its horns with pure gold; and you shall make for it a molding of gold all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Two gold rings you shall make for it, under the molding on both its sides. You shall place them on its two sides, and they shall be housings for the poles with which to carry it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you shall put it in front of the veil that is before the ark of the Testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the Testimony, where I will meet with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Aaron shall burn spiced incense on it every morning; when he tends the lamps, he shall burn it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when Aaron stirs up the lamps at evening, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You shall not offer strange incense on it, nor a burnt offering, nor a grain offering; nor shall you pour out a drink offering upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Aaron shall make atonement upon its horns once a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonement; once a year he shall make atonement upon it throughout your generations. It is set apart, holy, unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When you take a head count of the sons of Israel in numbering them, each man shall give a ransom for his soul unto Jehovah when you number them, that there may be no plague among them when you number them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is what everyone passing over to be numbered shall give: half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (a shekel is twenty gerahs). The half-shekel shall be an offering unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Everyone passing over to be numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when you give an offering unto Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you shall take the money of atonement from the sons of Israel, and shall designate it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the sons of Israel before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You shall also make a laver of bronze, its base also of bronze, with which to wash. You shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar. And you shall put water in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for Aaron and his sons to wash their hands and their feet there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When they go into the tent of meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister, to burn an offering by fire like incense unto Jehovah, they shall wash with water, that they not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they not die. And it shall be a perpetual statute to them; to him and his seed throughout their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moreover Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Take for yourself choice spices; five hundred shekels of flowing myrrh, half as much sweet-smelling cinnamon (two hundred and fifty shekels), two hundred and fifty shekels of sweet-smelling calamus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>five hundred shekels of cassia, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And you shall make from these a holy anointing oil, an ointment compound the product of the perfumer. It shall be a holy anointing oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With it you shall anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the Testimony;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the laver and its base.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You shall consecrate them, that they may be set apart, holy. Whatever touches them is holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, to serve Me as priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: This shall be a holy anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It shall not be poured upon manÂ’s flesh; nor shall you make any other like it, according to its proportions. It is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever gives any of it to a stranger, shall be cut off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jehovah said to Moses: Take spices; stacte and onycha and galbanum, and pure frankincense with these incense spices; part equal to part.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>You shall make of these an incense, a spice mixture the product of the perfumer, salted, pure, and holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And you shall pulverize some of it very fine, and put some of it before the Testimony in the tent of meeting where I will meet with you. It shall be set apart, holy, unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the incense which you make, you shall not make any for yourselves according to its proportions. It shall be holy unto you for Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Whoever makes any like it, to smell it, he shall be cut off from his people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
