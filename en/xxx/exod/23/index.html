Do not put your hand with the wicked to be an unjust witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You shall not follow the majority in doing evil; nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to turn aside after the majority to thrust aside justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You shall not show partiality to a poor man in his dispute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If you encounter your enemys ox or his donkey going astray, you shall bring it back to restore it to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying under its burden, you shall refrain from leaving it to him; you shall help him set it free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You shall not thrust aside the justice of your needy one in his dispute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Keep yourself far away from a false matter; do not kill the innocent and righteous. For I will not justify the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and perverts the words of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also you shall not oppress a sojourner, for you know the soul of a sojourner, because you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Six years you shall sow your land and gather in its produce,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the needy of your people may eat; and what they leave, the beasts of the field may eat. In like manner you shall do with your vineyard and your olive grove.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest, that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your female servant and the sojourner may be refreshed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And in all that I have said to you, beware and make no mention of any other gods by name, nor let it be heard from your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Three times a year you shall keep a feast unto Me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread (you shall eat unleavened bread seven days, as I have commanded you, at the time appointed in the month of Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt; no one shall appear before Me empty);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and the Feast of Harvest, the firstfruits of your labors which you have sown in the field; and the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you have gathered in your produce from the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with anything leavened; nor shall the fat of My feast remain until morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring into the house of Jehovah your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mothers milk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, I am sending an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Be on guard before Him and obey His voice; do not grieve Him, for He will not endure your transgressions; for My name is in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if you indeed obey His voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and will afflict those who besiege you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For My Angel will go before you and bring you in to the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites and the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their works; but you shall tear them down to overthrow them, and break and shatter their pillars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And you shall serve Jehovah your God, and He will bless your bread and your water. And I will take sickness away from the midst of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>No one shall suffer miscarriage nor be barren in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I will send My dread before you, I will cause confusion among all the people to whom you come, and will give the neck of all your enemies to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I will send hornets before you, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I will not drive them out before you in one year, that the land not become desolate and the beasts of the field become too numerous for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Little by little I will drive them out before you, until you are fruitful, and have taken possession of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I have set your borders from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River. For I will deliver up the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You shall not make any covenants with them, nor with their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against Me. For if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
