Nothing leavened shall be eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>On this day you are going out, in the month Abib.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it shall be, when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall do this service in this month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days. And nothing leavened shall be seen among you, nor shall leaven be seen among you in all your territories.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall make known to your son in that day, saying, This is because of what Jehovah did for me when I came up out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It shall be for a sign to you on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the Law of Jehovah may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Jehovah has brought you out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season year after year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it shall be, when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that you shall devote unto Jehovah all that open the womb: every firstborn offspring from an animal which you have; the males belong to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. And every firstborn of man among your children you shall redeem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What is this? that you shall say to him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt, from the house of bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that Jehovah killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore I sacrifice unto Jehovah every male that opens the womb, but every firstborn of my sons I redeem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall be for a sign on your hand and as frontlets between your eyes, for by strength of hand Jehovah has brought us forth out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God thought, Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So God led the people around by way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. And the children of Israel went up in battle array out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had sworn the sons of Israel to oath saying, God will attend to visit you, and you shall bring up my bones from here with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So they took their journey from Succoth and camped in Etham at the edge of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to shine on them, to go by day and night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
