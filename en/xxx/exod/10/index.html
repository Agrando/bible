Let My people go, that they may serve Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or else, if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they shall cover the face of the earth, so that no one will be able to see the land; and they shall eat the rest of what is left, which remains to you from the hail, and they shall eat every tree which grows up for you out of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they shall fill your houses, the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither your fathers nor your fathers fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day. And he turned and went out from Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Pharaohs servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt has vanished?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God. Who are the ones going?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said, We will go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we will go, for it is a feast unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, Jehovah be with you if ever I let you and your little ones go! Consider, for evil is before you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not so! Go now, you who are men, and serve Jehovah, for that is what you desired. And they were driven out from Pharaohs presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every plant of the land; all that the hail has left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and rested on all the territory of Egypt. Exceedingly numerous; previously there had been no such locusts as they, nor shall there be such after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they covered the eye of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. So there remained nothing green on the trees or on the plants of the field throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron in haste, and said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God and against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once, and entreat Jehovah your God, that He may take away from me this death only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he went out from Pharaoh and entreated Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jehovah turned a very strong wind from the west, which took the locusts away and blew them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the territory of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah hardened Pharaohs heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, darkness which may even be felt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses stretched out his hand toward the heavens, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They did not see one another; nor did anyone rise from his place for three days. But all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, Go, serve Jehovah; only let your flocks and your herds be kept back. Let your little ones also go with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses said, You must also give us sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may make offerings unto Jehovah our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Our livestock also shall go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind. For we must take some of them to serve Jehovah our God, and even we do not know with what we must serve Jehovah until we arrive there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jehovah hardened Pharaohs heart, and he would not let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Pharaoh said to him, Depart from me! Take heed to yourself and do not see my face again! For in the day you see my face you shall die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said, You have spoken correctly. I will not see your face again.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
