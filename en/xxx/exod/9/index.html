And Pharaohs heart was hardened, and he did not let the people go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, Take for yourselves handfuls of ashes from a furnace, and let Moses toss it toward the heavens before Pharaohs eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall become fine dust in all the land of Egypt, and it shall be an inflammation breaking out into boils upon man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they took ashes from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses tossed them toward the heavens. And they became inflammations breaking out into boils upon man and beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the inflammations, for the inflammations were upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh; and he did not heed them, as Jehovah had spoken to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of the Hebrews: Let My people go, that they may serve Me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for at this time I will send all My plagues upon your heart, and upon your servants and upon your people, that you may come to understand that there is no one like Me in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if I had stretched forth My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, then you would have been cut off from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And indeed for this purpose I have ordained you, to show My power in you, and to declare My name in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As yet you exalt yourself against My people in that you will not let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause very heavy hail to rain down, such as has not been in Egypt since its founding until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore send now and gather your livestock and all that you have in the field, for the hail shall come down upon every man and every animal which is found in the field and is not brought into shelter; and they shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The ones who feared the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee to the shelters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the ones who did not set their heart upon the word of Jehovah left their servants and their livestock in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch forth your hand toward the heavens, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt; upon man, upon beast, and upon every plant of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses stretched forth his staff toward the heavens; and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire went to the ground. And Jehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So there was hail, and fire in the midst of the hail, so very heavy that there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the hail struck throughout the whole land of Egypt, all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail struck every plant of the field and shattered every tree of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Pharaoh sent and summoned Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time. Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Entreat Jehovah, that there be no more Divine thundering and hail, for it is enough. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said to him, As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to Jehovah. The thunder shall cease, and there shall be no more hail; that you may know that the earth is Jehovahs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear before Jehovah God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now the flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the head and the flax was in bud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they are late crops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread out his hands to Jehovah. And the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had ceased, he sinned again, and hardened his heart; he and his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened; neither would he let the children of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
