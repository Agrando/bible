And he said, Let it be according to your word, that you may come to understand that there is no one like Jehovah our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the frogs shall depart from you, from your houses, from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. And Moses cried out to Jehovah concerning the frogs which He had brought against Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses. And the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courtyards, and out of the fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they piled them up in heaps, and the land stunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, his heart was hardened and he did not heed them; as Jehovah had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your staff, and strike the dust of the land, so that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they did so. For Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and it became lice upon man and beast. All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not. And there were lice upon man and beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God. But Pharaohs heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them; as Jehovah had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he comes out to the water, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah: Let My people go, that they may serve Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Or else, if you will not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon you and your servants, upon your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground where they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And for that day I have set apart the land of Goshen, in which My people remain, that no swarms of flies shall be there, in order that you may know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I have appointed a ransom for My people from your people. This sign shall be tomorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jehovah did so. Thick swarms of flies came into the house of Pharaoh, into his servants houses, and into all the land of Egypt. The land was spoiled because of the swarms of flies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron, and said, Go! Sacrifice to your God in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Moses said, It is not right to do so, for we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians unto Jehovah our God. If we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, then will they not stone us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We will go three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice unto Jehovah our God as He will command us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice unto Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Make supplication for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said, Indeed I am going out from you, and I will entreat Jehovah, that the swarms of flies may depart tomorrow from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. But let Pharaoh not continue dealing deceitfully in not letting the people go to sacrifice unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also; neither would he let the people go.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
