And he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. And he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Moses thought, I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, Moses! Moses! And he said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He said, Do not approach here. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Moreover He said, I am the God of your fathers; the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehovah said: I have given attention to see the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I have acknowledged their pain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and broad land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come unto Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Moses said to God, Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He said, I will certainly be with you. And this shall be a sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the sons of Israel and say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they say to me, What is His name? what shall I say to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And He said, Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover God said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel: Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My eternal name, and this is My memorial from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you and seen what is being done to you in Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and I intend to bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they will heed your voice; and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt; and you shall say to him, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has met with us; and now, please, let us go three days journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice unto Jehovah our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I have taken into consideration that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not except by a mighty hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in its midst; and after that he will let you go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians; and it shall come to pass, when you go, that you shall not leave empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, of her who sojourns in her house, articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters. Thus you shall plunder the Egyptians.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
