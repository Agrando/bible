The priesthood shall be theirs for a perpetual statute. Thus you shall confirm the hands of Aaron and his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall also have the bull brought before the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you shall kill the bull before Jehovah, by the door of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You shall take some of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour out all the blood at the base of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you shall take all the fat that covers the entrails, the fatty lobe attached to the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and burn them on the altar like incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the flesh of the bull, with its skin and its dung, you shall burn with fire outside the camp. It is a sin offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You shall also take one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and you shall kill the ram, and you shall take its blood and sprinkle it all around on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you shall cut the ram in pieces, wash its entrails and its legs, and put them with its pieces and with its head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you shall burn the whole ram on the altar like incense. It is a burnt offering unto Jehovah; it is a soothing aroma, an offering by fire unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall also take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you shall kill the ram, and take some of its blood and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood all around on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you shall take some of the blood that is on the altar, and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and on his garments, on his sons and on the garments of his sons with him. Thus he and his garments shall be consecrated, and his sons and his sons garments with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Also you shall take the fat of the ram, the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails, the fatty lobe attached to the liver, the two kidneys and the fat on them, the right thigh (for it is a ram of ordination),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>one loaf of bread, one cake made with oil, and one wafer from the basket of the unleavened bread that is before Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and you shall put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and you shall wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And you shall take them from their hands and burn them on the altar like incense as a burnt offering, as a soothing aroma before Jehovah. It is an offering by fire unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And you shall take the breast of the ram of Aarons ordination and wave it as a wave offering before Jehovah; and it shall be your portion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And from the ram of the ordination you shall consecrate the breast of the wave offering which is waved, and the thigh of the heave offering which is raised, of that which is for Aaron and of that which is for his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>It shall be for Aaron and his sons from the children of Israel as a perpetual statute; for it is a heave offering. It shall be a heave offering from the children of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, their heave offering unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons after him, to be anointed in them and to confirm their hands in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That son who becomes priest in his place shall put them on for seven days, when he enters the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And you shall take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in the consecrated place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, by the door of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to confirm their hands and to consecrate; but a stranger shall not eat them, because they are holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if any of the flesh of ordination, or of the bread, remains until the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it is holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus you shall do to Aaron and his sons, according to all that I have commanded you. Seven days you shall confirm their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And you shall offer a bull every day as a sin offering for atonement. You shall purify the altar when you make atonement for it, and you shall anoint it to consecrate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. And the altar shall be set apart, holy. Whatever touches the altar is consecrated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And this is what you shall offer on the altar: two lambs of the first year, day by day continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>One lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>With the one lamb shall be one-tenth of an ephah of flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and one-fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the other lamb you shall offer at evening; and you shall offer with it the grain offering and the drink offering, as in the morning, for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I will meet you to speak with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and it shall be honored by My glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Thus I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar. I will also consecrate Aaron and his sons unto Me as priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>I will dwell among the children of Israel and will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them. I am Jehovah their God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
