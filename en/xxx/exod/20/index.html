In it you shall not do any work; you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your sojourner who is within your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day.
