For with a strong hand he will let them go, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And God spoke to Moses and said to him: I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name Jehovah I have not been known to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were sojourners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I have also heard the groaning of the sons of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered My covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore say to the sons of Israel: I am Jehovah; I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, I will rescue you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I will take you to Myself as a people, and I will be God to you. And you shall know that I am Jehovah your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will bring you into the land which I raised My hand and swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you for a possession. I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses spoke thus to the sons of Israel; but they did not listen to Moses, because of anguish of spirit and cruel bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Go, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Moses spoke before Jehovah, saying, The sons of Israel have not listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh heed me, for I am of uncircumcised lips?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, and gave them a command for the sons of Israel, and for Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These were the heads of their fathers houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These were the families of Reuben.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the families of Simeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were one hundred and thirty-seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimi according to their families.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. And the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred and thirty-three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the families of Levi according to their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now Amram took for himself Jochebed, his fathers sister, as wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were one hundred and thirty-seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Zithri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Aaron took to himself Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nahshon, as wife; and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph.
