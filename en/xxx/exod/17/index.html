And Moses said to them, Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you tempt Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses, and said, Why is it you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Moses cried out to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Pass over before the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel. Also take in your hand your staff with which you struck the river, and go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the children of Israel, and because they tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah in our midst or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Amalek came and fought against Israel in Rephidim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said to Joshua, Choose some men and go fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So Joshua did as Moses said to him, to fight against Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And so it was, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But MosesÂ’ hands became heavy; so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. And Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in the book and recount it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses built an altar and called its name, Jehovah-My-Banner;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saying, Because Jehovah has sworn with His hand on the throne: Jehovah is at war with Amalek from generation to generation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
