And they built for Pharaoh supply cities, Pithom and Raamses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were in dread of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the Egyptians made the children of Israel work with harshness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they made their lives bitter with hard labor; in mortar, in brick, and in all manner of labor in the field. All their labor in which they made them work was with harshness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one was Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he said: When you do the duties of a midwife for the Hebrew women, and see them on the birthstools, if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, Why have you done this thing, and saved the male children alive?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly numerous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And so it was, because the midwives feared God, that He provided houses for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, Every son who is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
