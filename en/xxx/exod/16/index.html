For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from the heavens for you. And the people shall go out and gather in this matter day by day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My Law or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At evening you shall know that Jehovah has brought you out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And in the morning you shall see the glory of Jehovah; for He hears your murmuring against Jehovah. But what are we, that you grumble against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses said, You shall see when Jehovah gives you flesh to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to the full; for Jehovah hears your murmurings which you grumble against Him. And what are we? Your murmurings are not against us but against Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before Jehovah, for He has heard your murmurings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they turned and looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, At evening you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. And you shall know that I am Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass that quails came up at evening and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew all around the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the layer of dew lifted, there, on the surface of the wilderness, were small flakes, as fine as frost on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, Manna? For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which Jehovah has given you for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded: Let every man gather up food for each mouth, one omer per head; according to the number of souls let every man take for those in his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the children of Israel did so and gathered, some more, some less.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they measured it with the omer, he who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They gathered according to the food for each mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Moses said, Let no one leave any of it till morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nevertheless they did not heed Moses; but some of them left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and stunk. And Moses was furious with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they gathered it every morning, every man the food for his mouth. And when the sun became hot, it melted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass on the sixth day, that they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the leaders of the congregation came and reported to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, This is what Jehovah has said: Tomorrow is a rest, a holy Sabbath unto Jehovah. Bake what you will bake today, and boil what you will boil; and lay up for yourselves all that remains, to be kept until morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So they laid it up till morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not stink, nor were there any worms in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Moses said, Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath unto Jehovah; today you will not find it in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, there will be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it happened that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, and they found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My Laws?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Pay attention! For Jehovah has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days. Let every man remain in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the people rested on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the house of Israel called its name Manna. And it was like white coriander seed, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded: Fill an omer with it, to be kept for your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot and put an omer full of manna in it, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept for your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; they ate manna until they came into the borders of the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now an omer is one-tenth of an ephah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
