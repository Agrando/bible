And when she saw that he was good, she hid him three months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when she could no longer hide him, she took a vessel of reeds for him, daubed it with asphalt and pitch, put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river bank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his sister stood at a distance, to know what would be done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river. And her maidens were walking along the riverside; and when she saw the vessel among the reeds, she sent her maid to fetch it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the boy wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then his sister said to Pharaohs daughter, Shall I go and call a wet nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Pharaohs daughter said to her, Go. So the maiden went and called the childs mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Pharaohs daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages. So the woman took the child and nursed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaohs daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, saying, Because I drew him out of the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren and looked upon their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he looked this way and that, and when he saw no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he went out the second day, behold, two Hebrew men were fighting, and he said to the guilty one, Why are you striking the other fellow?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared and said, Surely this thing is known!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when Pharaoh heard of the matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. And they came and drew water, and they filled the troughs to water their fathers flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and delivered them, and watered their flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you have made haste today?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they said, An Egyptian man delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and proceeded to draw for us and watered the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Invite him, that he may eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses agreed to live with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have become a sojourner in a foreign land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass after many days that the king of Egypt died. And the children of Israel groaned because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And God gave attention to the children of Israel, and God acknowledged them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
