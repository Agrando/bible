And Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh to send the children of Israel out of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will harden Pharaohs heart, and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Pharaoh will not heed you, so that I may lay My hand upon Egypt and bring My hosts, My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt with great judgments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah when I stretch forth My hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses and Aaron did as Jehovah commanded them; thus they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, Show a sign for yourselves, then you shall say to Aaron, Take your staff and cast it before Pharaoh, and let it become a serpent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, just as Jehovah commanded. And Aaron cast down his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers. So the magicians of Egypt, they also did so with their enchantments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For every man threw down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aarons staff swallowed up their staffs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Pharaohs heart was hardened, and he did not heed them, as Jehovah had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah said to Moses: Pharaohs heart is hard; he refuses to let the people go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Go to Pharaoh in the morning, when he goes out to the water, and you shall stand by the rivers bank to meet him; and the staff which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you shall say to him, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness; but behold, until now you have not given heed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore thus says Jehovah: By this you shall know that I am Jehovah. Behold, I will strike the waters in the river with the staff that is in my hand, and they shall be turned to blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fish that are in the river shall die, the river shall stink, and the Egyptians shall weary themselves to drink the water of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their streams, over their rivers, over their ponds, and over all their bodies of water, that they may become blood. And there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, in vessels of both wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded. And he lifted up the staff and struck the waters that were in the river, in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants. And all the waters in the river were turned to blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the fish in the river died, the river stunk, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river. So there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments; and Pharaohs heart was hardened, and he did not heed them, as Jehovah had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Pharaoh turned and went into his house. Neither did he lay any of this to heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the Egyptians dug all around the river for water to drink, because they could not drink the water of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And seven days passed after Jehovah had struck the river.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
