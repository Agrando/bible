And Moses arose early in the morning and went up into Mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him; and he took in his hand the two tablets of stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehovah descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jehovah passed before him and proclaimed: Jehovah, Jehovah Mighty God, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in goodness and truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons and the sons sons to the third and the fourth generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses made haste and bowed down toward the earth, and prostrated himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, If now I have found favor in Your eyes, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray, go among us, even though we are a stiff-necked people; and forgive our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Your possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He said: Behold, I make a covenant. Before all your people I will do extraordinary things such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of Jehovah. For it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Observe what I command you this day. Behold, I am driving out before you the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Take heed to yourself, that you not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, that it not be a snare in your midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But you shall destroy their altars, break their sacred pillars, and chop down their groves</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(for you shall bow down to no other god, for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous Mighty God),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that you not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and you go whoring after their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and they invite you and you eat of their sacrifices,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and you take of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters go whoring after their gods and make your sons go whoring after their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You shall make no molten gods for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Feast of Unleavened Bread you shall keep. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I have commanded you, at the appointed time of the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Everything that opens the womb is Mine, and every male firstborn among your livestock, whether ox or sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb. And if you will not redeem him, then you shall break his neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And no one shall appear before Me empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall observe the Feast of Weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I will dispossess the nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither will any man covet your land when you go up to appear before Jehovah your God three times in the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leaven, nor shall the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover be left until morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring unto the house of Jehovah your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mothers milk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Write these words; according to these words at My mouth, I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water. And He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai (the two tablets of the Testimony being in Moses hand when he came down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone while He spoke with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he commanded them with all that Jehovah had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when Moses was finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But whenever Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with Him, he took the veil off until he came out; and he came out and spoke to the children of Israel whatever he was commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And whenever the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses face shone, then Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
