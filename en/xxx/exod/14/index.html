And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled, and the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people; and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he made ready his chariot and took his people with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took six hundred choice chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt with officers over every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; and the children of Israel went out with a high hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Egyptians pursued them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and overtook them camping by the sea beside Pi Hahiroth, before Baal Zephon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were pulling up after them. And they were greatly afraid, and the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you dealt so with us, to bring us up out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Was this not the word we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said to the people, Do not be afraid. Take your stand, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which He will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall not see again forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jehovah will fight for you, and you shall keep silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Why do you cry out to Me? Speak to the children of Israel that they set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. And the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them. And I will glorify Myself over Pharaoh and over all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have glorified Myself over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud went from before them and stood behind them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. Thus it was a cloud and darkness to the one, and it gave light by night to the other, so that the one did not come near the other all that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea into dry land, and the waters were divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Egyptians pursued and went after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaohs horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked down upon the camp of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud, and He confused the camp of the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And He took off their chariot wheels, so that they drove them with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel, for Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and when it turned to daybreak, the sea returned to normal, while the Egyptians were fleeing into it. And Jehovah shook out the Egyptians into the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them. Not so much as one of them remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the children of Israel had walked upon dry ground in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel saw the great hand which Jehovah had dealt against Egypt. And the people feared Jehovah, and believed Jehovah and His servant Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
