The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jehovah is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation; He is my Mighty God, and I will adorn Him; my fathers God, and I will exalt Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehovah is a man of war; Jehovah is His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Pharaohs chariots and his army He has cast into the sea; his chosen officers also are drowned in the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The abyss has covered them; they have sunk to the depths like a stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Your right hand, O Jehovah, is glorious in power; Your right hand, O Jehovah, has dashed the enemy to pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And in the greatness of Your majesty You have overthrown those who rose against You; You sent forth Your wrath; it consumed them like stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And with the blast of Your nostrils the waters were heaped up; the flowing waters stood upright like a heap; the depths hardened in the heart of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoils; my desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Who is like You, O Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like You, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You stretched out Your right hand; the earth swallowed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You in Your mercy have led forth the people whom You have redeemed; You have guided them in Your strength unto Your holy habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The people have heard and are afraid; anguish has taken hold of the inhabitants of Philistia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the chiefs of Edom have been dismayed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling takes hold of them; all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Fear and dread falls upon them; by the greatness of Your arm they are as still as a stone, till Your people pass over, O Jehovah, till the people whom You have redeemed pass over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You bring them in and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, in the place, O Jehovah, which You have made for Your own dwelling, the sanctuary, O Jehovah, which Your hands have established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehovah reigns from everlasting and forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the horses of Pharaoh went with his chariots and his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them. But the children of Israel have walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Miriam answered them: Sing unto Jehovah, for He has risen up to be exalted! The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea. And they went out into the Wilderness of Shur, and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the people grumbled against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he cried out unto Jehovah, and Jehovah showed him a tree. When he cast it into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There He made a statute and an ordinance for them. And there He tested them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and said: If you diligently heed the voice of Jehovah your God and do what is right in His eyes, give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have brought upon the Egyptians. For I am Jehovah who heals you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; so they camped there by the waters.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
