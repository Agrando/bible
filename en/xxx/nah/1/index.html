Jehovah takes vengeance against His foes, and He maintains wrath against His enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jehovah is slow to anger, and great of power, and He does not by any means acquit the guilty. Jehovah has His way in the tempest and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither, and the flower of Lebanon wilts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The mountains quake before Him, and the hills melt; and the earth is lifted up before Him, even the world and all who dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Who can stand before His indignation? And who can endure His burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken down because of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knows those who trust in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But with an overrunning flood He will make a complete end of its place, and darkness shall pursue His enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What are you plotting against Jehovah? He will make a complete end of it; affliction shall not rise up a second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For as thorns are woven together, and as their drunkards are drunken, they shall be devoured like fully dried straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>One who devises evil against Jehovah has come forth from you, one counseling worthlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus says Jehovah, Though they are secure and so numerous, yet they will be cut off and pass away. And though I have afflicted you, I will not afflict you any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now I will break off his yoke from you and will tear away your bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah has given command concerning you. Not one of your name shall be sown any more; I will cut off the carved image and the molten image out of the house of your gods; I will appoint your grave, for you are of no account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, on the mountains the feet of Him bearing good tidings, proclaiming, Peace! O Judah, keep your feasts; fulfill your vows; for the wicked will no more pass through you; he is completely cut off.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
