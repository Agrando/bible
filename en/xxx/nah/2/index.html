Guard the rampart; watch the way; make the loins strong, firm up your power exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For Jehovah has restored the excellence of Jacob as the excellence of Israel. For the emptiers have emptied them and have destroyed their vine branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The shield of his mighty ones has become red, the mighty men are clothed in scarlet, the chariots will come like iron torches in the day of his preparation, and the cypresses are made to shake terribly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The chariots run madly in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways. Their appearance is like torches; they run swiftly like lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He shall remember its nobles; they shall stumble in their walking; they shall hurry to its wall, and the defense shall be prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be melted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she who stood firm shall be uncovered and carried away; and her maidservants shall lead on, moaning like the sound of doves, beating on their breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Nineveh of old is like a pool of water; yet they are fleeing. They cry, Halt! Halt! But no one turns back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! For there is no end to the treasures, and riches from all precious objects.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She is empty, desolate, and waste. And the heart is melted, and the knees knocking; and trembling is in all the loins; and all of their faces are flushed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Where is the den of the lions and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion, the lioness, the lionÂ’s cub walked, and no one made them afraid?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The lion tore in pieces, enough for his cubs, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, even his lairs with torn prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, I am against you, declares Jehovah of Hosts; and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions. And I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall not be heard any more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
