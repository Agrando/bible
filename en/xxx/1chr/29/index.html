Who then is willing to consecrate his hand this day unto Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the heads of the fathers, chiefs of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with the officers over the kingÂ’s business, offered free-will offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And those with whom precious stones were found, gave them to the treasury of the house of Jehovah, into the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the people rejoiced, for they had offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they had offered willingly unto Jehovah; and King David also rejoiced with great joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David blessed Jehovah before the eyes of all the assembly, and David said: Blessed are You, Jehovah the God of Israel, our Father, forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yours, O Jehovah, is the greatness, the power and the glory, the victory and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on earth is Yours; Yours is the kingdom, O Jehovah, and You are exalted as head over all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Both riches and honor come from before You, and You reign over all. In Your hand is power and might; it is in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now therefore, our God, we are giving thanks to You and praising Your glorious name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things are from You, and out of Your own hand we have given to You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we are strangers and sojourners before You, as were all our fathers; our days on earth are as a shadow, and there is no hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O Jehovah our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build You a house for Your holy name is out of Your hand, and is all Your own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I know also, my God, that You examine the heart and take pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things; and now with joy I have seen Your people who are found here, to offer willingly to You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the intent of the thoughts of the heart of Your people, and fix their heart toward You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And give my son Solomon a perfect heart to keep Your commandments and Your testimonies and Your statutes, to do all these things, and to build the temple for which I have made provision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David said to all the assembly, Now bless Jehovah your God. So all the assembly blessed Jehovah the God of their fathers, and bowed down and prostrated themselves before Jehovah and the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they slaughtered sacrifices unto Jehovah and offered burnt offerings unto Jehovah on the next day: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they ate and drank before Jehovah with great gladness that day. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before Jehovah as the prince, and Zadok as priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>All the rulers and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, set themselves under the hand of King Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus Jehovah highly magnified Solomon in the eyes of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thus David the son of Jesse had reigned over all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the days that he reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he died in a good old age, satisfied with days, riches and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now the acts of King David, first and last, behold they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>of all his reign and his might, and the events that happened to him, to Israel, and to all the kingdoms of the lands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
