But David stayed at Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and overthrew it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And David took their kings crown from his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. And it was set on Davids head. Also he brought out the spoils of the city; a very great amount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he brought out the people who were in it, and cut them with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. Thus David did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it happened afterward that war rose up at Gezer with the Philistines, at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai, who was born to the giant. And they were subdued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Again there was war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weavers beam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, with twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand and six on each foot; and he also had been born to the giant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So when he reproached Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, Davids brother, killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
