And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the Word of Jehovah by the hand of Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus, where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come in here. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the City of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And David said, Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief commander. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and became chief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the City of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he built the city all around, from the Millo and all around. And Joab restored the rest of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David went on, proceeding to greatness, for Jehovah of Hosts was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>These were the heads of the mighty men with David, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the Word of Jehovah concerning Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is the number of Davids mighty men: Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite, chief of the thirty; he had lifted up his spear against three hundred, killed at one time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was among the three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He was with David at Pasdammim. Now the Philistines had gathered there for battle, and there was a parcel of land full of barley; and the people had fled before the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But they took their stand in the middle of that field, recovered it, and killed the Philistines. And Jehovah saved by a great deliverance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David said longingly, Oh, that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem by the gate, and took it and brought it to David. But David would not drink it, but poured it out to Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and said, Far be it from me, O my God, to do this. Shall I drink the blood of these men with their souls? For at the risk of their lives they have brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things were done by the three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of another three. He had lifted up his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and had a name among the three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Of the three he was more honored than the other two; therefore he became their commander. However he did not attain to the first three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done many deeds. He had killed two lion-like ones of Moab. He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he killed an Egyptian, a man five cubits in stature. In the Egyptians hand was a spear like a weavers beam; and he went down to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptians hand, and killed him with his own spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name among the three mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, he was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain to the first three. And David appointed him over his guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the mighty ones of the army were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Sibbechai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite (the armorbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite (a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Hanan the son of Maachah, Joshaphat the Mithnite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
