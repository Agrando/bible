I will now make preparation for it. So David made abundant preparations before his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he summoned his son Solomon, and charged him to build a house for Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And David said to Solomon: My son, as for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Jehovah my God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, You have shed much blood and have made great wars; you shall not build a house for My name, because you have shed much blood on the earth before Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be Solomon, for I will give peace and tranquillity to Israel in his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son, and I will be his Father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, my son, may Jehovah be with you; and may you prosper, and build the house of Jehovah your God, as He has spoken concerning you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Only may Jehovah give you wisdom and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel, to keep the Law of Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then you will prosper, if you take care to fulfill the statutes and judgments which Jehovah has commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and of good courage; do not fear nor be dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weight, for it is in abundance. I have prepared timber and stone also, and you may add to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance: hewers and craftsmen in stone and timber, and wise men for every kind of work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There is no counting the gold and silver and bronze and iron. Arise and get to work; for Jehovah is with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>David also commanded all the rulers of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is not Jehovah your God with you? And has He not given you rest all around? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued before Jehovah and before His people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now give your hearts and your souls to seek Jehovah your God. Therefore arise and build the sanctuary of Jehovah God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for the name of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
