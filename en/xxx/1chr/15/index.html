David also wore a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting and with the sound of the shofar, with trumpets and with cymbals, sounding aloud with lutes and harps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it happened, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the City of David, that Michal, SaulÂ’s daughter, looked through a window and saw King David whirling and playing; and she despised him in her heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
