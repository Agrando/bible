I have also subdued all your enemies. Furthermore I declare to you that Jehovah shall build you a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it shall be, when your days have been fulfilled to go to your fathers, that I will raise up your seed after you from your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will be his Father, and he shall be My son; and I will not take My mercy away from him, as I took it from him who was before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will establish him in My house and in My kingdom forever; and his throne shall be established forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to all these words and according to all this vision, thus Nathan spoke to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then King David went in and sat before Jehovah, and he said: Who am I, O Jehovah God? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And yet this was a small thing in Your eyes, O God; and You have also spoken of Your servants house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the manner of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What more can David add to You for the honor of Your servant? For You have known Your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Jehovah, for Your servants sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness, to make known all this greatness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Jehovah, there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And what single nation on the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God has gone to redeem for Himself as a people; to make for Yourself a great name to be feared, to drive out nations before Your people whom You redeemed out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For You designated Your people Israel as Your people forever; and You, Jehovah, have become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And now, O Jehovah, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, let it be established forever, and do as You have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let it even be established, that Your name may be magnified forever, saying, Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, God to Israel. And let the house of Your servant David be established before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For You, O my God, have disclosed to Your servants ear that You will build him a house. Therefore Your servant has found heart to pray before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now, Jehovah, You are God, and have promised this goodness to Your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, that it may be before You forever; for You have blessed it, O Jehovah, and it is blessed forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
