Indeed, the hand of the rulers and officials has been foremost in this treachery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So when I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and plucked out some of the hair of my head and beard, and sat down astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then everyone who trembled at the Words of the God of Israel assembled to me, because of the treachery of those who had been carried away captive, and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>At the evening sacrifice I arose from my fasting; and having torn my garment and my robe, I fell on my knees and spread out my hands to Jehovah my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I said: O my God, I am too ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to You, my God; for our iniquities have increased over our heads, and our guilt has grown up to the Heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Since the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt, and for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to shame of faces, to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And now for a little while grace has been shown from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we were slaves; yet our God did not forsake us in our bondage; but He extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to revive us, to set up the house of our God, to rebuild its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>which You have commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land, with the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now therefore, do not give your daughters for their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons; nor seek after their peace or prosperity forever, that you may be strong and eat the good of the land, and leave it as an inheritance to your children forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, since You our God have held back from the bending down in punishment of our iniquities, and have given us such deliverance as this,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>should we again break Your commandments, and join in marriage with the people of these abominations? Would You not be angry with us until You had finished us off, so that there would be no remnant or escapee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>O Jehovah the God of Israel, You are righteous, for we are left as refugees, as it is this day. Here we are before You, in our guilt, for no one can stand before You because of this!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
