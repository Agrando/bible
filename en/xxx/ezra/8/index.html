And I considered the people and the priests, and found none of the sons of Levi there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib and Elnathan, men of understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I gave them a command for Iddo, chief of the place Casiphia, and I put words in their mouth to speak to Iddo and his brethren the temple slaves at the place Casiphia; that they should bring to us servants for the house of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then, by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, with his sons and brothers, eighteen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>also of the temple slaves, whom David and the rulers had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty temple slaves. All of them were designated by name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from Him the right way for us and our little ones and all our possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I was ashamed to request of the king troops and horsemen to help us against the enemy along the road, because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all those for good who seek Him, but His power and His wrath are against all those who forsake Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So we fasted and entreated our God for this, and He was entreated of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests; Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the articles, the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his rulers, and all Israel who were present, had contributed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, silver articles weighing one hundred talents, one hundred talents of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>twenty gold basins worth a thousand drachmas, and two vessels of fine polished bronze, precious as gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I said to them, You are holy unto Jehovah; the articles are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto Jehovah the God of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Watch and keep them until you weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites and heads of the fathers of Israel in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the priests and the Levites accepted the silver and the gold by weight and the articles, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. And the hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambush along the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So we came to Jerusalem, and remained there three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the articles were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; with them were the Levites, Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>with the number and weight of everything. All the weight was written down at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The children of those who had been carried away captive, who had come from the captivity, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they delivered the kings orders to the kings satraps and the governors in the region beyond the River. So they gave support to the people and the house of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
