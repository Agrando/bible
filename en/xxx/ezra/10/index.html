We also are with you. Be strong, and do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Ezra arose, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel swear an oath that they would do according to this word. So they swore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and when he came there, he ate no bread and drank no water, for he mourned because of the guilt of those from the captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they issued a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the sons of the captivity, to assemble at Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the rulers and elders, all his property would be destroyed, and he himself would be excluded from the assembly of those from the captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered at Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth of the month; and all the people sat in the open square of the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, You have transgressed and have dwelt with foreign women, adding to the guilt of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now therefore, make confession to Jehovah the God of your fathers, and do His will; separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, Yes! As you have said, so we need to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But there are many people; it is the season for heavy rain, and we are not able to stand outside. Nor is this the work of one or two days, for there are many of us who have transgressed in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Please, let our rulers be appointed out of the whole assembly; and let all those in our cities who have dwelt with foreign women come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of their cities, until the fierce wrath of our God in this matter is turned away from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah stood against this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the sons of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest set apart some of the men, heads of fathers, according to the houses of their fathers, each of them by name; and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By the first day of the first month they finished investigating all the men who had dwelt with foreign women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And among the sons of the priests who had dwelt with foreign women, the following were found of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they gave their hands that they would put away their women; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Also of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Also of the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (the same is Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Also of the singers: Eliashib; and of the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And others of Israel: of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, Jeziah, Malchiah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Eliah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Ramoth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>of the sons of Pahath-Moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasau,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Bani, Binnui, Shimei,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, Joel, and Benaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>All these had taken foreign women, some being women with whom they brought forth children.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
