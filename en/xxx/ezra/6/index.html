Let the expenses be paid out of the kings house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Also let the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and taken back to the temple in Jerusalem, each to its place; and deposit them in the house of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now therefore, Tatnai, governor of the region beyond the River, and Shethar-Boznai, and your associates the Persians who are beyond the River, keep yourselves far from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Moreover I issue a decree as to what you shall do for the elders of these Jews, for the building of this house of God: Let the kings riches from the tribute of the region beyond the River be diligently given to these men for their expenses, so that they are not hindered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And whatever they need; young bulls, rams, and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of Heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the command of the priests who are in Jerusalem; let it be given them day by day without fail,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>that they may offer sacrifices of soothing aroma unto the God of Heaven, and pray for the life of the king and his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Also I issue a decree that whoever alters this edict, let a timber be pulled from his house and erected, and let him be hanged on it; and let his house be made a refuse heap for this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And may the God who causes His name to dwell there destroy any king or people who put their hand to alter it, or to destroy this house of God which is in Jerusalem. I, Darius, issue a decree; let it be done diligently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Tatnai, governor of the region beyond the River, Shethar-Boznai, and their associates diligently did according to what King Darius had sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the command of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the house was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites and the rest of the sons of the captivity, carried out the dedication of this house of God with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they offered at the dedication of this house of God, one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They assigned the priests to their divisions and the Levites to their divisions, over the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the sons of the captivity observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the priests and the Levites were purified together; all of them were pure. And they slaughtered the Passover lambs for all the sons of the captivity, for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the children of Israel who had returned from the captivity ate together with all who had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the nations of the land in order to seek Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy; for Jehovah had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
