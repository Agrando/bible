Then they replied by letter concerning this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is a copy of the letter that Tatnai, the governor of the region beyond the River, and Shethar-Boznai, and his associates, the Persians who were in the region beyond the River, sent to Darius the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus: To Darius the king: All peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is being built with rolling stones, and timber is being laid in the walls; and this work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then we asked those elders, and spoke thus to them: Who commanded you to build this house and to finish these walls?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We also asked them their names to inform you, that we might write the names of the men who are chief among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And thus they returned an answer to us, saying: We are the servants of the God of Heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But because our fathers provoked the God of Heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who has destroyed this house and carried the people away to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to build this house of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple that was in Jerusalem and carried into the temple of Babylon; those King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon, and they were given to one named Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to him, Take these articles; go, carry them to the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then that same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the house of God in Jerusalem; but from that time even until now it has been building, and it is not yet finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the kingÂ’s treasure house, which is there in Babylon, to find out whether it is so that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send us his will concerning this matter.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
