we wish, then, to know what these things would wish to be;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and all Athenians, and the strangers sojourning, for nothing else were at leisure but to say something, and to hear some newer thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Paul, having stood in the midst of the Areopagus, said, 'Men, Athenians, in all things I perceive you as over-religious;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for passing through and contemplating your objects of worship, I found also an erection on which had been inscribed: To God -- unknown; whom, therefore -- not knowing -- you do worship, this One I announce to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>'God, who did make the world, and all things in it, this One, of heaven and of earth being Lord, in temples made with hands does not dwell,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>neither by the hands of men is He served -- needing anything, He giving to all life, and breath, and all things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He made also of one blood every nation of men, to dwell upon all the face of the earth -- having ordained times before appointed, and the bounds of their dwellings --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to seek the Lord, if perhaps they did feel after Him and find, -- though, indeed, He is not far from each one of us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for in Him we live, and move, and are; as also certain of your poets have said: For of Him also we are offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>'Being, therefore, offspring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead to be like to gold, or silver, or stone, graving of art and device of man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>the times, indeed, therefore, of the ignorance God having overlooked, does now command all men everywhere to reform,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>because He did set a day in which He is about to judge the world in righteousness, by a man whom He did ordain, having given assurance to all, having raised him out of the dead.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And having heard of a rising again of the dead, some, indeed, were mocking, but others said, 'We will hear you again concerning this;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and so Paul went forth from the midst of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and certain men having cleaved to him, did believe, among whom is also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman, by name Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
