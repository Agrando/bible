And we were in this city abiding certain days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>on the sabbath-day also we went forth outside of the city, by a river, where there used to be prayer, and having sat down, we were speaking to the women who came together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, was hearing, whose heart the Lord did open to attend to the things spoken by Paul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and when she was baptized, and her household, she did call upon us, saying, 'If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, having entered into my house, remain;' and she constrained us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass in our going on to prayer, a certain maid, having a spirit of Python, did meet us, who brought much employment to her masters by soothsaying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>she having followed Paul and us, was crying, saying, 'These men are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us a way of salvation;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and this she was doing for many days, but Paul having been grieved, and having turned, said to the spirit, 'I command you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come forth from her;' and it came forth the same hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And her masters having seen that the hope of their employment was gone, having caught Paul and Silas, drew them to the market-place, unto the rulers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and having brought them to the magistrates, they said, 'These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and they proclaim customs that are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates having torn their garments from them, were commanding to beat them with rods,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>many blows also having laid upon them, they cast them to prison, having given charge to the jailor to keep them safely,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who such a charge having received, did put them to the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, were singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were hearing them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and suddenly a great earthquake came, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, opened also presently were all the doors, and of all -- the bands were loosed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the jailor having come out of sleep, and having seen the doors of the prison open, having drawn a sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to be fled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, 'You may not do yourself any harm, for we are all here.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, having asked for a light, he sprang in, and trembling he fell down before Paul and Silas,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and having brought them forth, said, 'Sirs, what must I do -- that I may be saved?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and they said, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved -- you and your house;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all those in his household;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and having taken them, in that hour of the night, he did bathe them from the blows, and was baptized, himself and all his presently,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>having brought them also into his house, he set food before them, and was glad with all the household, he having believed in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And day having come, the magistrates sent the rod-bearers, saying, 'Let those men go;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and the jailor told these words unto Paul -- 'The magistrates have sent, that you may be let go; now, therefore, having gone forth go on in peace;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and Paul said to them, 'Having beaten us publicly uncondemned -- men, Romans being -- they did cast us to prison, and now privately do they cast us forth! why no! but having come themselves, let them bring us forth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the rod-bearers told to the magistrates these sayings, and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and having come, they besought them, and having brought them forth, they were asking them to go forth from the city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and they, having gone forth out of the prison, entered into the house of Lydia, and having seen the brethren, they comforted them, and went forth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
