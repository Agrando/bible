hard for you against pricks to kick!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>'And I said, Who are you, Lord? and he said, I am Jesus whom you do persecute;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but rise, and stand upon your feet, for this I appeared to you, to appoint you an officer and a witness both of the things you did see, and of the thingsin which I will appear to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>delivering you from the people, and the nations, to whom now I send you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to open their eyes, to turnthem from darkness to light, and from the authority of the Adversary unto God, for their receiving forgiveness of sins, and a lot among those having been sanctified, by faith that is toward me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>'Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but to those in Damascus first, and to those in Jerusalem, to all the region also of Judea, and to the nations, I was preaching to reform, and to turn back unto God, doing works worthy of reformation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>because of these things the Jews -- having caught me in the temple -- were endeavouring to kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>'Having obtained, therefore, help from God, till this day, I have stood witnessing both to small and to great, saying nothing besides the things that both the prophets and Moses spake of as about to come,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that the Christ is to suffer, whether first by a rising from the dead, he is about to proclaim light to the people and to the nations.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, he thus making a defence, Festus with a loud voice said, 'You are mad, Paul; much learning does turn you mad;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and he said, 'I am not mad, most noble Festus, but of truth and soberness the sayings I speak forth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for the king does know concerning these things, before whom also I speak boldly, for none of these things, I am persuaded, are hidden from him; for this thing has not been done in a corner;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>you do believe, king Agrippa, the prophets? I have known that you do believe!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Agrippa said unto Paul, 'In a little you do persuade me to become a Christian!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and Paul said, 'I would have wished to God, both in a little, and in much, not only you, but also all those hearing me to-day, to become such as I also am -- except these bonds.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, he having spoken these things, the king rose up, and the governor, Bernice also, and those sitting with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and having withdrawn, they were speaking unto one another, saying -- 'This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and Agrippa said to Festus, 'This man might have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
