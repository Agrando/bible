and if a spirit spake to him, or a messenger, we may not fight against God;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and a great dissension having come, the chief captain having been afraid lest Paul may be pulled to pieces by them, commanded the soldiery, having gone down, to take him by force out of the midst of them, and to bring him to the castle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And on the following night, the Lord having stood by him, said, 'Take courage, Paul, for as you did fully testify the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so it behooves you also at Rome to testify.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And day having come, certain of the Jews having made a concourse, did anathematize themselves, saying neither to eat nor to drink till they may kill Paul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and they were more than forty who made this conspiracy by oath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who having come near to the chief priests and to the elders said, 'With an anathema we did anathematize ourselves -- to taste nothing till we have killed Paul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>now, therefore, you, signify you to the chief captain, with the sanhedrin, that to-morrow he may bring him down unto you, as being about to know more exactly the things concerning him; and we, before his coming near, are ready to put him to death.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the son of Paul's sister having heard of the lying in wait, having gone and entered into the castle, told Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and Paul having called near one of the centurions, said, 'This young man lead unto the chief captain, for he has something to tell him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He indeed, then, having taken him, brought him unto the chief captain, and said, 'The prisoner Paul, having called me near, asked me this young man to bring unto you, having something to say to you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the chief captain having taken him by the hand, and having withdrawn by themselves, inquired, 'What is that which you hast to tell me?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and he said -- 'The Jews agreed to request you, that to-morrow to the sanhedrin you may bring down Paul, as being about to enquire something more exactly concerning him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>you, therefore, may you not yield to them, for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who did anathematize themselves -- not to eat nor to drink till they kill him, and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The chief captain, then, indeed, let the young man go, having charged him to tell no one, 'that these things you did show unto me;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and having called near a certain two of the centurions, he said, 'Make ready soldiers two hundred, that they may go on unto Caesarea, and horsemen seventy, and spearmen two hundred, from the third hour of the night;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>beasts also provide, that, having set Paul on, they may bring him safe unto Felix the governor;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>he having written a letter after this description:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>'Claudius Lysias, to the most noble governor Felix, hail:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This man having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them -- having come with the soldiery, I rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and, intending to know the cause for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their sanhedrin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>whom I found accused concerning questions of their law, and having no accusation worthy of death or bonds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and a plot having been intimated to me against this man -- about to be of the Jews -- at once I sent unto you, having given command also to the accusers to say the things against him before you;
