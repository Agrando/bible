and he said unto me, I am Jesus the Nazarene whom you do persecute --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and they who are with me the light did see, and became afraid, and the voice they heard not of him who is speaking to me --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and I said, What shall I do, Lord? and the Lord said unto me, Having risen, go on to Damascus, and there it shall be told you concerning all things that have been appointed for you to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>'And when I did not see from the glory of that light, being led by the hand by those who are with me, I came to Damascus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and a certain one, Ananias, a pious man according to the law, being testified to by all the Jews dwelling there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>having come unto me and stood by me, said to me, Saul, brother, look up; and I the same hour did look up to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and he said, The God of our fathers did choose you beforehand to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice out of his mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>because you shall be his witness unto all men of what you hast seen and heard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and now, why tarry you? having risen, baptize yourself, and wash away your sins, calling upon the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>'And it came to pass when I returned to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple, I came into a trance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and I saw him saying to me, Haste and go forth in haste out of Jerusalem, because they will not receive your testimony concerning me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and I said, Lord, they -- they know that I was imprisoning and was scourging in every synagogue those believing on you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and when the blood of your witness Stephen was being poured forth, I also was standing by and assenting to his death, and keeping the garments of those putting him to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he said unto me, Go, because to nations far off I will send you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were hearing him unto this word, and they lifted up their voice, saying, 'Away from the earth with such an one; for it is not fit for him to live.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they crying out and casting up their garments, and throwing dust into the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, saying, 'By scourges let him be examined;' that he might know for what cause they were crying so against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as he was stretching him with the thongs, Paul said unto the centurion who was standing by, 'A man, a Roman, uncondemned -- is it lawful to you to scourge;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and the centurion having heard, having gone near to the chief captain, told, saying, 'Take heed what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the chief captain having come near, said to him, 'Tell me, are you a Roman?' and he said, 'Yes;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the chief captain answered, 'I, with a great sum, did obtain this citizenship;' but Paul said, 'But I have been even born so.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Immediately, therefore, they departed from him who are about to examine him, and the chief captain also was afraid, having learned that he is a Roman, and because he had bound him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and on the morrow, intending to know the certainty therefore he is accused by the Jews, he did loose him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their sanhedrin to come, and having brought down Paul, he set him before them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
