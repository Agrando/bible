And the chief priest having come, and those with him, they called together the sanhedrin and all the senate of the sons of Israel, and they sent to the prison to have them brought,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the officers having come, did not find them in the prison, and having turned back, they told,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>saying -- 'The prison indeed we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors, and having opened -- within we found no one.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And as the priest, and the magistrate of the temple, and the chief priests, heard these words, they were doubting concerning them to what this would come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and coming near, a certain one told them, saying -- 'Lo, the men whom you did put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then the magistrate having gone away with officers, brought them without violence, for they were fearing the people, lest they should be stoned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and having brought them, they set them in the sanhedrin, and the chief priest questioned them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying, 'Did not we strictly command you not to teach in this name? and lo, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring upon us the blood of this man.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Peter and the apostles answering, said, 'To obey God it behooves, rather than men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and the God of our fathers did raise up Jesus, whom you slew, having hanged upon a tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>this one God, a Prince and a Saviour, has exalted with His right hand, to give reformation to Israel, and forgiveness of sins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and we are His witnesses of these sayings, and the Holy Spirit also, whom God gave to those obeying him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they having heard, were cut to the heart, and were taking counsel to slay them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but a certain one, having risen up in the sanhedrin -- a Pharisee, by name Gamaliel, a teacher of law honoured by all the people -- commanded to put the apostles forth a little,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and said unto them, 'Men, Israelites, take heed to yourselves about these men, what you are about to do,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for before these days rose up Theudas, saying, that himself was some one, to whom a number of men did join themselves, as it were four hundred, who was slain, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered, and came to nought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>'After this one rose up, Judas the Galilean, in the days of the enrollment, and drew away much people after him, and that one perished, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone, because if this counsel or this work may be of men, it will be overthrown,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and if it be of God, you are not able to overthrow it, lest perhaps also you be found fighting against God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And to him they agreed, and having called near the apostles, having beaten them, they commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>they, indeed, then, departed from the presence of the sanhedrin, rejoicing that for his name they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>every day also in the temple, and in every house, they were not ceasing teaching and proclaiming good news -- Jesus the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
