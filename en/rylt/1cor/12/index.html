if the whole hearing, where the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and now, God did set the members each one of them in the body, according as He willed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and if all were one member, where the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and now, indeed, are many members, and one body;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and an eye is not able to say to the hand, 'I have no need of you;' nor again the head to the feet, 'I have no need of you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But much more the members of the body which seem to be more infirm are necessary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and those that we think to be less honourable of the body, around these we put more abundant honour, and our unseemly things have seemliness more abundant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and our seemly things have no need; but God did temper the body together, to the lacking part having given more abundant honour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same anxiety for one another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and whether one member does suffer, suffer with it do all the members, or one member is glorified, rejoice with it do all the members;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and you are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And some, indeed, did God set in the assembly, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, afterwards powers, afterwards gifts of healings, helpings, governings, divers kinds of tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all powers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and desire earnestly the better gifts; and yet a far excelling way do I show to you:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
