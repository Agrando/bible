evil communications corrupt good manners;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>awake up, as is right, and sin not; for certain have an ignorance of God; for shame to you I say it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But some one will say, 'How do the dead rise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>unwise! you -- what you do sow is not quickened except it may die;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and that which you do sow, not the body that shall be do you sow, but bare grain, it may be of wheat, or of some one of the others,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and God does give to it a body according as He willed, and to each of the seeds its proper body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fishes, and another of birds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and there are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but one is the glory of the heavenly, and another that of the earthly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>one glory of sun, and another glory of moon, and another glory of stars, for star from star does differ in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So also is the rising again of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body; there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>so also it has been written, 'The first man Adam became a living creature,' the last Adam is for a life-giving spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>but that which is spiritual is not first, but that which was natural, afterwards that which is spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord out of heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>as is the earthy, such are also the earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are also the heavenly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and, according as we did bear the image of the earthy, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood the reign of God is not able to inherit, nor does the corruption inherit the incorruption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>lo, I tell you a secret; we indeed shall not all sleep, and we all shall be changed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, in the last trumpet, for it shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we -- we shall be changed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>for it behooves this corruptible to put on incorruption, and this mortal to put on immortality;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and when this corruptible may have put on incorruption, and this mortal may have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the word that has been written, 'The Death was swallowed up -- to victory;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>where, O Death, thy sting? where, O Hades, thy victory?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and the sting of the death is the sin, and the power of the sin the law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>and to God -- thanks, to Him who is giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>so that, my brethren beloved, become you stedfast, unmovable, abounding in the work of the Lord at all times, knowing that your labour is not vain in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
