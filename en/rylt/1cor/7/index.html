or what, have you known, O husband, whether the wife you shalt save?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>if not, as God did distribute to each, as the Lord has called each -- so let him walk; and thus in all the assemblies do I direct:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>being circumcised -- was any one called? let him not become uncircumcised; in uncircumcision was any one called? let him not be circumcised;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the circumcision is nothing, and the uncircumcision is nothing -- but a keeping of the commands of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Each in the calling in which he was called -- in this let him remain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>a servant -- wast you called? be not anxious; but if also you are able to become free -- use it rather;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for he who is in the Lord -- having been called a servant -- is the Lord's freedman: in like manner also he the freeman, having been called, is servant of Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>with a price you were bought, become not servants of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>each, in that in which he was called, brethren, in this let him remain with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And concerning the virgins, a command of the Lord I have not; and I give judgment as having obtained kindness from the Lord to be faithful:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I suppose, therefore, this to be good because of the present necessity, that it is good for a man that the matter be thus: --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Have you been bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed; have you been loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But and if you may marry, you did not sin; and if the virgin may marry, she did not sin; and such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And this I say, brethren, the time henceforth is having been shortened -- that both those having wives may be as not having;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and those weeping, as not weeping; and those rejoicing, as not rejoicing; and those buying, as not possessing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and those using this world, as not using it up; for passing away is the fashion of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I wish you to be without anxiety; the unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the married is anxious for the things of the world, how he shall please the wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The wife and the virgin have been distinguished: the unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit, and the married is anxious for the things of the world, how she shall please the husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And this for your own profit I say: not that I may cast a noose upon you, but for the seemliness and devotedness to the Lord, undistractedly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and if any one does think it to be unseemly to his virgin, if she may be beyond the bloom of age, and it ought so to be, what he wills let him do; he does not sin -- let him marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he who has stood stedfast in the heart -- not having necessity -- and has authority over his own will, and this he has determined in his heart -- to keep his own virgin -- does well;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>so that both he who is giving in marriage does well, and he who is not giving in marriage does better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A wife has been bound by law as long time as her husband may live, and if her husband may sleep, she is free to be married to whom she will -- only in the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and she is happier if she may so remain -- according to my judgment; and I think I also have the Spirit of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
