I do not praise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I -- I received from the Lord that which also I did deliver to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and having given thanks, he brake, and said, 'Take you, eat you, this is my body, that for you is being broken; this do you -- to the remembrance of me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In like manner also the cup after the supping, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood; this do you, as often as you may drinkit -- to the remembrance of me;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for as often as you may eat this bread, and this cup may drink, the death of the Lord you do show forth -- till he may come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>so that whoever may eat this bread or may drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, guilty he shall be of the body and blood of the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and let a man be proving himself, and so of the bread let him eat, and of the cup let him drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for he who is eating and drinking unworthily, judgment to himself he does eat and drink -- not discerning the body of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because of this, among you many are weak and sickly, and sleep do many;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>for if ourselves we were discerning, we would not be being judged,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and being judged by the Lord, we are chastened, that with the world we may not be condemned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>so then, my brethren, coming together to eat, for one another wait you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and if any one is hungry, at home let him eat, that to judgment you may not come together; and the rest, whenever I may come, I shall arrange.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
