and none of you does the law; why me do you seek to kill?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The multitude answered and said, 'You have a demon, who does seek to kill you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said to them, 'One work I did, and you all wonder,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>because of this, Moses has given you the circumcision -- not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers -- and on a sabbath you circumcise a man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>if a man does receive circumcision on a sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you wroth with me that I made a man all whole on a sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>judge not according to appearance, but the righteous judgment judge.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Certain, therefore, of the Jerusalemites said, 'Is not this he whom they are seeking to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and, lo, he does speak freely, and they say nothing to him; did the rulers at all know truly that this is truly the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but this one -- we have known whence he is; and the Christ, when he does come, no one does know whence he is.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus cried, therefore, in the temple, teaching and saying, 'You have both known me, and you have known whence I am; and I have not come of myself, but He who sent me is true, whom you have not known;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and I have known Him, because I am from Him, and He did send me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They were seeking, therefore, to seize him, and no one laid the hand on him, because his hour had not yet come,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and many out of the multitude did believe in him, and said -- 'The Christ -- when he may come -- will he do more signs than these that this one did?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers that they may take him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus, therefore, said to them, 'Yet a little time I am with you, and I go away unto Him who sent me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>you will seek me, and you shall not find; and where I am, you are not able to come.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Jews, therefore, said among themselves, 'Whither is this one about to go that we shall not find him? -- to the dispersion of the Greeks is he about to go? and to teach the Greeks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>what is this word that he said, You will seek me, and you shall not find? and, Where I am, you are not able to come?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And in the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, 'If any one does thirst, let him come unto me and drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>he who is believing in me, according as the Writing said, Rivers out of his belly shall flow of living water;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and this he said of the Spirit, which those believing in him were about to receive; for not yet was the Holy Spirit, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Many, therefore out of the multitude, having heard the word, said, 'This is truly the Prophet;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>others said, 'This is the Christ;' and others said, 'Why, out of Galilee does the Christ come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Did not the Writing say, that out of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem -- the village where David was -- the Christ does come?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>A division, therefore, arose among the multitude because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And certain of them were willing to seize him, but no one laid hands on him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>the officers came, therefore, unto the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, 'Therefore did you not bring him?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, 'Never so spake man -- as this man.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Pharisees, therefore, answered them, 'Have you also been led astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>did any one out of the rulers believe in him? or out of the Pharisees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>but this multitude, that is not knowing the law, is accursed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus said unto them -- he who came by night unto him -- being one of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>'Does our law judge the man, if it may not hear from him first, and know what he does?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered and said to him, 'Art you also out of Galilee? search and see, that a prophet out of Galilee has not risen;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and each one went on to his house, but Jesus went on to the mount of the Olives.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
