Simon Peter, therefore, having heard that it is the Lord, did gird on the outer coat, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the other disciples came by the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but as it were about two hundred cubits off, dragging the net of the fishes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>when, therefore, they came to the land, they behold a fire of coals lying, and a fish lying on it, and bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said to them, 'Bring you from the fishes that you caught now;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net up on the land, full of great fishes, an hundred fifty and three, and though they were so many, the net was not rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus said to them, 'Come you, dine;' and none of the disciples was venturing to inquire of him, 'Who are you?' knowing that it is the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus, therefore, does come and take the bread and give to them, and the fish in like manner;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>this is now a third time Jesus was manifested to his disciples, having been raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When, therefore, they dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon,son of Jonas, do you love me more than these?' he said to him, 'Yes, Lord; you have known that I dearly love you;' he said to him, 'Feed my lambs.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said to him again, a second time, 'Simon,son of Jonas, do you love me?' he said to him, 'Yes, Lord; you have known that I dearly love you;' he said to him, 'Tend my sheep.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said to him the third time, 'Simon,son of Jonas, do you dearly love me?' Peter was grieved that he said to him the third time, 'Do you dearly love me?' and he said to him, 'Lord, you have known all things; you do know that I dearly love you.' Jesus said to him, 'Feed my sheep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>verily, verily, I say to you, When you were younger, you were girding yourself and were walking whither you did will, but when you may be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another will gird you, and shall carryyou whither you do not will;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and this he said, signifying by what death he shall glorify God; and having said this, he said to him, 'Be following me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Peter having turned about does see the disciple whom Jesus was loving following, (who also reclined in the supper on his breast, and said, 'Sir, who is he who is delivering you up?')</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter having seen this one, said to Jesus, 'Lord, and what of this one?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to him, 'If him I will to remain till I come, what -- to you? be you following me.' This word, therefore, went forth to the brethren that that disciple does not die,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>yet Jesus did not say to him, that he does not die, but, 'If him I will to remain till I come, what -- to you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>this is the disciple who is testifying concerning these things, and he wrote these things, and we have known that his testimony is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there are also many other things -- as many as Jesus did -- which, if they may be written one by one, not even the world itself I think to have place for the books written. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
