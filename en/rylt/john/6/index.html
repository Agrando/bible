name="1">1</a>After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee (of Tiberias),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and there was following him a great multitude, because they were seeing his signs that he was doing on the ailing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and Jesus went up to the mount, and he was there sitting with his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and the passover was near, the feast of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus then having lifted up his eyes and having seen that a great multitude does come to him, said unto Philip, 'Whence shall we buy loaves, that these may eat?' --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and this he said, trying him, for he himself had known what he was about to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Philip answered him, 'Two hundred denaries' worth of loaves are not sufficient to them, that each of them may receive some little;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>one of his disciples -- Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter -- said to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>'There is one little lad here who has five barley loaves, and two fishes, but these -- what are they to so many?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jesus said, 'Make the men to sit down;' and there was much grass in the place, the men then sat down, in number, as it were, five thousand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those reclining, in like manner, also of the little fishes as much as they wished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they were filled, he said to his disciples, 'Gather together the broken pieces that are over, that nothing may be lost;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>they gathered together, therefore, and filled twelve hand-baskets with broken pieces, from the five barley loaves that were over to those having eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The men, then, having seen the sign that Jesus did, said -- 'This is truly the Prophet, who is coming to the world;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus, therefore, having known that they are about to come, and to take him by force that they may make him king, retired again to the mountain himself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and having entered into the boat, they were going over the sea to Capernaum, and darkness had already come, and Jesus had not come unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>the sea also -- a great wind blowing -- was being raised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>having pushed onwards, therefore, about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and coming near to the boat, and they were afraid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and he said to them, 'I amhe, be not afraid;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>they were willing then to receive him into the boat, and immediately the boat came unto the land to which they were going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the morrow, the multitude that was standing on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other little boat there except one -- that into which his disciples entered -- and that Jesus went not in with his disciples into the little boat, but his disciples went away alone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>(and other little boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they did eat the bread, the Lord having given thanks),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they also themselves did enter into the boats, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and having found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, 'Rabbi, when have you come hither?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered them and said, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were satisfied;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>work not for the food that is perishing, but for the food that is remaining to life age-during, which the Son of Man will give to you, for him did the Father seal --even God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They said therefore unto him, 'What may we do that we may work the works of God?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered and said to them, 'This is the work of God, that you may believe in him whom He did send.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They said therefore to him, 'What sign, then, do you, that we may see and may believe you? what do you work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>our fathers the manna did eat in the wilderness, according as it is having been written, Bread out of the heaven He gave them to eat.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus, therefore, said to them, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread out of the heaven; but my Father does give you the true bread out of the heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>for the bread of God is that which is coming down out of the heaven, and giving life to the world.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They said, therefore, unto him, 'Sir, always give us this bread.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus said to them, 'I am the bread of the life; he who is coming unto me may not hunger, and he who is believing in me may not thirst -- at any time;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>but I said to you, that you also have seen me, and you believe not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>all that the Father does give to me will come unto me; and him who is coming unto me, I may in no wise cast without,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>because I have come down out of the heaven, not that I may do my will, but the will of Him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>'And this is the will of the Father who sent me, that all that He has given to me I may not lose of it, but may raise it up in the last day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and this is the will of Him who sent me, that every one who is beholding the Son, and is believing in him, may have life age-during, and I will raise him up in the last day.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Jews, therefore, were murmuring at him, because he said, 'I am the bread that came down out of the heaven;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they said, 'Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we have known? how then said this one -- Out of the heaven I have come down?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus answered, therefore, and said to them, 'Murmur not one with another;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>no one is able to come unto me, if the Father who sent me may not draw him, and I will raise him up in the last day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>it is having been written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God; every one therefore who heard from the Father, and learned, comes to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>not that any one has seen the Father, except he who is from God, he has seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>'Verily, verily, I say to you, He who is believing in me, has life age-during;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am the bread of the life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>your fathers did eat the manna in the wilderness, and they died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>this is the bread that out of the heaven is coming down, that any one may eat of it, and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>'I am the living bread that came down out of the heaven; if any one may eat of this bread he shall live -- to the age; and the bread also that I will give is my flesh, that I will give for the life of the world.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews, therefore, were striving with one another, saying, 'How is this one able to give us his flesh to eat?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Jesus, therefore, said to them, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, If you may not eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and may not drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>he who is eating my flesh, and is drinking my blood, has life age-during, and I will raise him up in the last day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>for my flesh truly is food, and my blood truly is drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>he who is eating my flesh, and is drinking my blood, does remain in me, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>'According as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, he also who is eating me, even that one shall live because of me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>this is the bread that came down out of the heaven; not as your fathers did eat the manna, and died; he who is eating this bread shall live -- to the age.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>These things he said in a synagogue, teaching in Capernaum;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>many, therefore, of his disciples having heard, said, 'This word is hard; who is able to hear it?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Jesus having known in himself that his disciples are murmuring about this, said to them, 'Does this stumble you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>if then you may behold the Son of Man going up where he was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>the spirit it is that is giving life; the flesh does not profit anything; the sayings that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>but there are certain of you who do not believe;' for Jesus had known from the beginning who they are who are not believing, and who is he who will deliver him up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>and he said, 'Because of this I have said to you -- No one is able to come unto me, if it may not have been given him from my Father.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>From this time many of his disciples went away backward, and were no more walking with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Jesus, therefore, said to the twelve, 'Do you also wish to go away?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Simon Peter, therefore, answered him, 'Sir, unto whom shall we go? you have sayings of life age-during;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>and we have believed, and we have known, that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jesus answered them, 'Did not I choose you -- the twelve? and of you -- one is a devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And he spake of Judas, Simon's son, Iscariot, for he was about to deliver him up, being one of the twelve.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
