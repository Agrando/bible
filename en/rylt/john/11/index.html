but we may go to him;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>therefore said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to the fellow-disciples, 'We may go -- we also, that we may die with him,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus, therefore, having come, found him having been four days already in the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and many of the Jews had come unto Martha and Mary, that they might comfort them concerning their brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Martha, therefore, when she heard that Jesus does come, met him, and Mary kept sitting in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Martha, therefore, said unto Jesus, 'Sir, if you hadst been here, my brother had not died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but even now, I have known that whatever you may ask of God, God will give to you;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to her, 'Your brother shall rise again.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha said to him, 'I have known that he will rise again, in the rising again in the last day;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said to her, 'I am the rising again, and the life; he who is believing in me, even if he may die, shall live;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and every one who is living and believing in me shall not die -- to the age;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>believe you this?' she said to him, 'Yes, sir, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming to the world.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And these things having said, she went away, and called Mary her sister privately, saying, 'The Teacher is present, and does call you;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>she, when she heard, rises up quickly, and does come to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was in the place where Martha met him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the Jews, therefore, who were with her in the house, and were comforting her, having seen Mary that she rose up quickly and went forth, followed her, saying -- 'She does go away to the tomb, that she may weep there.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, having seen him, fell at his feet, saying to him, 'Sir, if you hadst been here, my brother had not died;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, did groan in the spirit, and troubled himself, and he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>'Where have you laid him?' they say to him, 'Sir, come and see;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Jews, therefore, said, 'Lo, how he was loving him!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and certain of them said, 'Was not this one, who did open the eyes of the blind man, able to cause that also this one might not have died?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus, therefore, again groaning in himself, comes to the tomb, and it was a cave, and a stone was lying upon it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, 'Take you away the stone;' the sister of him who has died -- Martha -- said to him, 'Sir, already he stinks, for he is four days dead;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus said to her, 'Said I not to you, that if you may believe, you shall see the glory of God?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They took away, therefore, the stone where the dead was laid, and Jesus lifted his eyes upwards, and said, 'Father, I thank You, that You did hear me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and I knew that You always do hear me, but, because of the multitude that is standing by, I saidit, that they may believe that You did send me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And these things saying, with a loud voice he cried out, 'Lazarus, come forth;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and he who died came forth, being bound feet and hands with grave-clothes, and his visage with a napkin was bound about; Jesus said to them, 'Loose him, and suffer to go.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Many, therefore, of the Jews who came unto Mary, and beheld what Jesus did, believed in him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>but certain of them went away unto the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus did;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>the chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered together a sanhedrin, and said, 'What may we do? because this man does many signs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>if we may let him alone thus, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and will take away both our place and nation.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest of that year, said to them, 'You have not known anything,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>nor reason that it is good for us that one man may die for the people, and not the whole nation perish.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And this he said not of himself, but being chief priest of that year, he did prophesy that Jesus was about to die for the nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and not for the nation only, but that also the children of God, who have been scattered abroad, he may gather together into one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>From that day, therefore, they took counsel together that they may kill him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus, therefore, was no more freely walking among the Jews, but went away thence to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>they were seeking, therefore, Jesus, and said one with another, standing in the temple, 'What does appear to you -- that he may not come to the feast?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>and both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if any one may know where he is, he may show it, so that they may seize him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
