Jesus therefore having been weary from the journeying, was sitting thus on the well; it was as it were the sixth hour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>there comes a woman out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, 'Give me to drink;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for his disciples were gone away to the city, that they may buy victuals;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>the Samaritan woman therefore said to him, 'How do you, being a Jew, ask drink from me, being a Samaritan woman?' for Jews have no dealing with Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to her, 'If you hadst known the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, Give me to drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The woman said to him, 'Sir, you have not even a vessel to draw with, and the well is deep; whence, then, have you the living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who did give us the well, and himself out of it did drink, and his sons, and his cattle?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered and said to her, 'Every one who is drinking of this water shall thirst again;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but whoever may drink of the water that I will give him, may not thirst -- to the age; and the water that I will give him shall become in him a well of water, springing up to life age-during.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman said unto him, 'Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, 'Go, call your husband, and come hither;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the woman answered and said, 'I have not a husband.' Jesus said to her, 'Well did you say -- A husband I have not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for five husbands you have had, and, now, he whom you have is not your husband; this have you said truly.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman said to him, 'Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>our fathers in this mountain did worship, and you -- you say that in Jerusalem is the place where it behooves to worship.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to her, 'Woman, believe me, that there does come an hour, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall you worship the Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>you worship what you have not known; we worship what we have known, because the salvation is of the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but, there comes an hour, and it now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father also does seek such to worship him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Godis a Spirit, and those worshipping Him, in spirit and truth it does behoove to worship.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman said to him, 'I have known that Messiah does come, who is called Christ, when that one may come, he will tell us all things;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus said to her, 'I amhe, who am speaking to you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And upon this came his disciples, and were wondering that with a woman he was speaking, no one, however, said, 'What seek you?' or 'Why speak you with her?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The woman then left her water-jug, and went away to the city, and said to the men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>'Come, see a man, who told me all things -- as many as I did; is this the Christ?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They went forth therefore out of the city, and were coming unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And in the meanwhile his disciples were asking him, saying, 'Rabbi, eat;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and he said to them, 'I have food to eat that you have not known.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The disciples then said one to another, 'Did any one bring him anything to eat?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them, 'My food is, that I may do the will of Him who sent me, and may finish His work;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>do not say that it is yet four months, and the harvest comes; lo, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and see the fields, that they are white unto harvest already.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>'And he who is reaping does receive a reward, and does gather fruit to life age-during, that both he who is sowing and he who is reaping may rejoice together;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>for in this the saying is the true one, that one is the sower and another the reaper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I sent you to reap that on which you have not laboured; others laboured, and you into their labour have entered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And from that city many believed in him, of the Samaritans, because of the word of the woman testifying, -- 'He told me all things -- as many as I did.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When, then, the Samaritans came unto him, they were asking him to remain with them, and he remained there two days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and many more did believe because of his word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and said to the woman -- 'No more because of your speaking do we believe; for we ourselves have heard and known that this is truly the Saviour of the world -- the Christ.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And after the two days he went forth thence, and went away to Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>for Jesus himself testified that a prophet in his own country shall not have honour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>when then, he came to Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all things that he did in Jerusalem in the feast -- for they also went to the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Jesus came, therefore, again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine, and there was a certain courtier, whose son was ailing in Capernaum,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>he, having heard that Jesus is come out of Judea to Galilee, went away unto him, and was asking him that he may come down and may heal his son, for he was about to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus then said unto him, 'If signs and wonders you may not see, you will not believe.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The courtier said unto him, 'Sir, come down before my child die;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said to him, 'Be going on; your son does live.' And the man believed the word that Jesus said to him, and was going on,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and he now going down, his servants met him, and told, saying -- 'Your child does live;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>he inquired then of them the hour in which he became better, and they said to him -- 'Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>then the father knew that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him -- 'Your son does live,' and he himself believed, and his whole house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>this again a second sign did Jesus, having come out of Judea to Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
