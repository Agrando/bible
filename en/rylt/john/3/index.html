thus is every one who has been born of the Spirit.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered and said to him, 'How are these things able to happen?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to him, 'You art the teacher of Israel -- and these things you do not know!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>'Verily, verily, I say to you -- What we have known we speak, and what we have seen we testify, and our testimony you do not receive;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>if the earthly things I said to you, and you do not believe, how, if I shall say to you the heavenly things, will you believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and no one has gone up to the heaven, except he who out of the heaven came down -- the Son of Man who is in the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>'And as Moses did lift up the serpent in the wilderness, so it behooves the Son of Man to be lifted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that every one who is believing in him may not perish, but may have life age-during,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for God did so love the world, that His Son -- the only begotten -- He gave, that every one who is believing in him may not perish, but may have life age-during.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God did not send His Son to the world that he may judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>he who is believing in him is not judged, but he who is not believing has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>'And this is the judgment, that the light has come to the world, and men did love the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for every one who is doing wicked things hates the light, and does not come unto the light, that his works may not be detected;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but he who is doing the truth does come to the light, that his works may be manifested, that in God they are having been wrought.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After these things came Jesus and his disciples to the land of Judea, and there he did tarry with them, and was baptizing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and John was also baptizing in Aenon, near to Salem, because there were many waters there, and they were coming and were being baptized --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for John was not yet cast into the prison --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>there arose then a question from the disciples of John with some Jews about purifying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and they came unto John, and said to him, 'Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you did testify, lo, this one is baptizing, and all are coming unto him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered and said, 'A man is not able to receive anything, if it may not have been given him from the heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>you yourselves do testify to me that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am having been sent before him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>he who is having the bride is bridegroom, and the friend of the bridegroom, who is standing and hearing him, with joy does rejoice because of the voice of the bridegroom;
