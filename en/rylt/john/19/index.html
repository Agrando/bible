Have you not known that I have authority to crucify you, and I have authority to release you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered, 'You wouldst have no authority against me, if it were not having been given you from above; because of this, he who is delivering me up to you has greater sin.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From this time was Pilate seeking to release him, and the Jews were crying out, saying, 'If this one you may release, you are not a friend of Caesar; every one making himself a king, does speak against Caesar.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Pilate, therefore, having heard this word, brought Jesus without -- and he sat down upon the tribunal -- to a place called, 'Pavement,' and in Hebrew, Gabbatha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and it was the preparation of the passover, and as it were the sixth hour, and he said to the Jews, 'Lo, your king!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and they cried out, 'Take away, take away, crucify him;' Pilate said to them, 'Your king shall I crucify?' the chief priests answered, 'We have no king except Caesar.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then, therefore, he delivered him up to them, that he may be crucified, and they took Jesus and led him away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and bearing his cross, he went forth to the place called Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>where they crucified him, and with him two others, on this side, and on that side, and Jesus in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross, and it was written, 'Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>this title, therefore, read many of the Jews, because the place was near to the city where Jesus was crucified, and it was having been written in Hebrew, in Greek, in Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The chief priests of the Jews said, therefore, to Pilate, 'Write not -- The king of the Jews, but that one said, I am king of the Jews;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered, 'What I have written, I have written.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The soldiers, therefore, when they did crucify Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to each soldier a part, also the coat, and the coat was seamless, from the top woven throughout,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>they said, therefore, to one another, 'We may not rend it, but cast a lot for it, whose it shall be;' that the Writing might be fulfilled, that is saying, 'They divided my garments to themselves, and upon my raiment they did cast a lot;' the soldiers, therefore, indeed, did these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleopas, and Mary the Magdalene;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus, therefore, having seen his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he was loving, he said to his mother, 'Woman, lo, your son;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>afterward he said to the disciple, 'Lo, your mother;' and from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this, Jesus knowing that all things now have been finished, that the Writing may be fulfilled, said, 'I thirst;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>a vessel, therefore, was placed full of vinegar, and they having filled a sponge with vinegar, and having put it around a hyssop stalk, did put it to his mouth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>when, therefore, Jesus received the vinegar, he said, 'It has been finished;' and having bowed the head, gave up the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews, therefore, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, since it was the preparation, (for that sabbath day was a great one,) asked of Pilate that their legs may be broken, and they taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The soldiers, therefore, came, and of the first indeed they did break the legs, and of the other who was crucified with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and having come to Jesus, when they saw him already having been dead, they did not break his legs;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but one of the soldiers with a spear did pierce his side, and immediately there came forth blood and water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true, and that one has known that true things he speaks, that you also may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For these things came to pass, that the Writing may be fulfilled, 'A bone of him shall not be broken;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and again another Writing said, 'They shall look to him whom they did pierce.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And after these things did Joseph of Arimathea -- being a disciple of Jesus, but concealed, through the fear of the Jews -- ask of Pilate, that he may take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave leave; he came, therefore, and took away the body of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and Nicodemus also came -- who came unto Jesus by night at the first -- bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, as it were, a hundred pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They took, therefore, the body of Jesus, and bound it with linen clothes with the spices, according as it was the custom of the Jews to prepare for burial;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and there was in the place where he was crucified a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one was yet laid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>there, therefore, because of the preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
