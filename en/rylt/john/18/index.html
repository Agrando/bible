or did others say it to you about me?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Pilate answered, 'Am I a Jew? your nation, and the chief priests did deliver you up to me; what did you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my officers had struggled that I might not be delivered up to Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Pilate, therefore, said to him, 'Art you then a king?' Jesus answered, 'You do sayit; because a king I am, I for this have been born, and for this I have come to the world, that I may testify to the truth; every one who is of the truth, does hear my voice.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pilate said to him, 'What is truth?' and this having said, again he went forth unto the Jews, and said to them, 'I do find no fault in him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and you have a custom that I shall release to you one in the passover; will you, therefore, that I shall release to you the king of the Jews?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>therefore they all cried out again, saying, 'Not this one -- but Barabbas;' and Barabbas was a robber.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
