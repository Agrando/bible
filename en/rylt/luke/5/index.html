who is able to forgive sins, except God only?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus having known their reasonings, answering, said unto them, 'What reason you in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>which is easier -- to say, Your sins have been forgiven you? or to say, Arise, and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>'And that you may know that the Son of Man has authority upon the earth to forgive sins -- (he said to the one struck with palsy) -- I say to you, Arise, and having taken up your little couch, be going on to your house.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And presently having risen before them, having taken up that on which he was lying, he went away to his house, glorifying God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and astonishment took all, and they were glorifying God, and were filled with fear, saying -- 'We saw strange things to-day.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after these things he went forth, and beheld a tax-gatherer, by name Levi, sitting at the tax-office, and said to him, 'Be following me;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he, having left all, having arisen, did follow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Levi made a great entertainment to him in his house, and there was a great multitude of tax-gatherers and others who were with them reclining (at meat),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and the scribes and the Pharisees among them were murmuring at his disciples, saying, 'Therefore with tax-gatherers and sinners do you eat and drink?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jesus answering said unto them, 'They who are well have no need of a physician, but they that are ill:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I came not to call righteous men, but sinners, to reformation.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they said unto him, 'Therefore do the disciples of John fast often, and make supplications -- in like manner also those of the Pharisees -- but yours do eat and drink?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said unto them, 'Are you able to make the sons of the bride-chamber -- in the bridegroom being with them -- to fast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but days will come, and, when the bridegroom may be taken away from them, then they shall fast in those days.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he spake also a simile unto them -- 'No one a patch of new clothing does put on old clothing, and if otherwise, the new also does make a rent, and with the old the patch does not agree, thatis from the new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>'And no one does put new wine into old skins, and if otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be poured out, and the skins will be destroyed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but new wine into new skins is to be put, and both are preserved together;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and no one having drunk oldwine, does immediately wish new, for he says, The old is better.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
