then you shall have glory before those reclining with you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said also to him who did call him, 'When you may make a dinner or a supper, be not calling your friends, nor your brethren, nor your kindred, nor rich neighbours, lest they may also call you again, and a recompense may come to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but when you may make a feast, be calling poor, maimed, lame, blind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and happy you shall be, because they have not to recompense you, for it shall be recompensed to you in the rising again of the righteous.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of those reclining with him, having heard these things, said to him, 'Happy is he who shall eat bread in the reign of God;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he said to him, 'A certain man made a great supper, and called many,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and he sent his servant at the hour of the supper to say to those having been called, Be coming, because now are all things ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>'And they began with one consent all to excuse themselves: The first said to him, A field I bought, and I have need to go forth and see it; I beg of you, have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>'And another said, Five yoke of oxen I bought, and I go on to prove them; I beg of you, have me excused:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and another said, A wife I married, and because of this I am not able to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>'And that servant having come, told to his lord these things, then the master of the house, having been angry, said to his servant, Go forth quickly to the broad places and lanes of the city, and the poor, and maimed, and lame, and blind, bring in hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>'And the servant said, Sir, it has been done as you did command, and still there is room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>'And the lord said unto the servant, Go forth to the ways and hedges, and constrain to come in, that my house may be filled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for I say to you, that none of those men who have been called shall taste of my supper.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there were going on with him great multitudes, and having turned, he said unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>'If any one does come unto me, and does not hate his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, and yet even his own life, he is not able to be my disciple;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and whoever does not bear his cross, and come after me, is not able to be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>'For who of you, willing to build a tower, does not first, having sat down, count the expense, whether he have the things for completing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>lest that he having laid a foundation, and not being able to finish, all who are beholding may begin to mock him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying -- This man began to build, and was not able to finish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>'Or what king going on to engage with another king in war, does not, having sat down, first consult if he be able with ten thousand to meet him who with twenty thousand is coming against him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and if not so -- he being yet a long way off -- having sent an embassy, he does ask the things for peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>'So, then, every one of you who does not take leave of all that he himself has, is not able to be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>'The saltis good, but if the salt does become tasteless, with what shall it be seasoned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>neither for land nor for manure is it fit -- they cast it without. He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
