These things saying, he was calling, 'He having ears to hear -- let him hear.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And his disciples were questioning him, saying, 'What may this simile be?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, 'To you it has been given to know the secrets of the reign of God, and to the rest in similes; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>'And this is the simile: The seed is the word of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and those beside the way are those hearing, then comes the Devil, and takes up the word from their heart, lest having believed, they may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>'And those upon the rock: They who, when they may hear, with joy do receive the word, and these have no root, who for a time believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>'And that which fell to the thorns: These are they who have heard, and going forth, through anxieties, and riches, and pleasures of life, are choked, and bear not to completion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>'And that in the good ground: These are they, who in an upright and good heart, having heard the word, do retainit, and bear fruit in continuance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>'And no one having lighted a lamp does cover it with a vessel, or under a couch does putit; but upon a lamp-stand he does put it, that those coming in may see the light,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for nothing is secret, that shall not become manifest, nor hid, that shall not be known, and become manifest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>'See, therefore, how you hear, for whoever may have, there shall be given to him, and whoever may not have, also what he seems to have, shall be taken from him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And there came unto him his mother and brethren, and they were not able to get to him because of the multitude,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and it was told him, saying, 'Your mother and your brethren do stand without, wishing to see you;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he answering said unto them, 'My mother and my brethren! they are those who the word of God are hearing, and doing.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, on one of the days, that he himself went into a boat with his disciples, and he said unto them, 'We may go over to the other side of the lake;' and they set forth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and as they are sailing he fell deeply asleep, and there came down a storm of wind to the lake, and they were filling, and were in peril.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And having come near, they awoke him, saying, 'Master, master, we perish;' and he, having arisen, rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there came a calm,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and he said to them, 'Where is your faith?' and they being afraid did wonder, saying unto one another, 'Who, then, is this, that even the winds he does command, and the water, and they obey him?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they sailed down to the region of the Gadarenes, that is across from Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he having gone forth upon the land, there met him a certain man, out of the city, who had demons for a long time, and with a garment was not clothed, and in a house was not abiding, but in the tombs,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and having seen Jesus, and having cried out, he fell before him, and with a loud voice, said, 'What -- to me and to you, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I beseech you, may you not afflict me!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he commanded the unclean spirit to come forth from the man, for many times it had caught him, and he was being bound with chains and fetters -- guarded, and breaking asunder the bonds he was driven by the demons to the deserts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus questioned him, saying, 'What is your name?' and he said, 'Legion,' (because many demons were entered into him,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and he was calling on him, that he may not command them to go away to the abyss,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and there was there a herd of many swine feeding in the mountain, and they were calling on him, that he might suffer them to enter into these, and he suffered them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the demons having gone forth from the man, did enter into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep to the lake, and were choked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And those feeding them, having seen what was come to pass, fled, and having gone, told it to the city, and to the fields;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and they came forth to see what was come to pass, and they came unto Jesus, and found the man sitting, out of whom the demons had gone forth, clothed, and right-minded, at the feet of Jesus, and they were afraid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and those also having seen it, told them how the demoniac was saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the whole multitude of the region of the Gadarenes round about asked him to go away from them, because with great fear they were pressed, and he having entered into the boat, did turn back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the man from whom the demons had gone forth was beseeching of him to be with him, and Jesus sent him away, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>'Turn back to your house, and tell how great things God did to you;' and he went away through all the city proclaiming how great things Jesus did to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And it came to pass, in the turning back of Jesus, the multitude received him, for they were all looking for him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and lo, there came a man, whose name is Jairus, and he was a chief of the synagogue, and having fallen at the feet of Jesus, was calling on him to come to his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>because he had an only daughter about twelve years old, and she was dying. And in his going away, the multitudes were thronging him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and a woman, having an issue of blood for twelve years, who, having spent on physicians all her living, was not able to be healed by any,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>having come near behind, touched the fringe of his garment, and presently the issue of her blood stood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jesus said, 'Whois it that touched me?' and all denying, Peter and those with him said, 'Master, the multitudes press you, and throng you, and you do say, Whois it that touched me!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jesus said, 'Some one did touch me, for I knew power having gone forth from me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And the woman, having seen that she was not hid, trembling, came, and having fallen before him, for what cause she touched him declared to him before all the people, and how she was healed presently;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and he said to her, 'Take courage, daughter, your faith has saved you, be going on to peace.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>While he is yet speaking, there does come a certain one from the chief of the synagogue's house, saying to him -- 'Your daughter has died, harass not the Teacher;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and Jesus having heard, answered him, saying, 'Be not afraid, only believe, and she shall be saved.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And having come to the house, he suffered no one to go in, except Peter, and James, and John, and the father of the child, and the mother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and they were all weeping, and beating themselves for her, and he said, 'Weep not, she did not die, but does sleep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and they were deriding him, knowing that she did die;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and he having put all forth without, and having taken hold of her hand, called, saying, 'Child, arise;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and her spirit came back, and she arose presently, and he directed that there be given to her to eat;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and her parents were amazed, but he charged them to say to no one what was come to pass.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
