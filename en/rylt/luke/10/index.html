beseech you then the Lord of the harvest, that He may put forth workmen to His harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>'Go away; lo, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>carry no bag, no scrip, nor sandals; and salute no one on the way;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and into whatever house you do enter, first say, Peace to this house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and if indeed there may be there the son of peace, rest on it shall your peace; and if not so, upon you it shall turn back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>'And in that house remain, eating and drinking the things they have, for worthyis the workman of his hire; go not from house to house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and into whatever city you enter, and they may receive you, eat the things set before you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and heal the ailing in it, and say to them, The reign of God has come near to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>'And into whatever city you do enter, and they may not receive you, having gone forth to its broad places, say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the dust that has cleaved to us, from your city, we do wipe off against you, but this know you, that the reign of God has come near to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and I say to you, that for Sodom in that day it shall be more tolerable than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>'Woo to you, Chorazin; woo to you, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you, long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, they had reformed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>'And you, Capernaum, which unto the heaven was exalted, unto hades you shall be brought down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>'He who is hearing you, does hear me; and he who is putting you away, does put me away; and he who is putting me away, does put away Him who sent me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the seventy turned back with joy, saying, 'Sir, and the demons are being subjected to us in your name;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he said to them, 'I was beholding the Adversary, as lightning from the heaven having fallen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>lo, I give to you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy, and nothing by any means shall hurt you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice rather that your names were written in the heavens.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that hour was Jesus glad in the Spirit, and said, 'I do confess to you, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that You did hide these things from wise men and understanding, and did reveal them to babes; yes, Father, because so it became good pleasure before You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>'All things were delivered up to me by my Father, and no one does know who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whom the Son may wish to revealHim.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having turned unto the disciples, he said, by themselves, 'Happy the eyes that are perceiving what you perceive;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for I say to you, that many prophets and kings did wish to see what you perceive, and did not see, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And lo, a certain lawyer stood up, trying him, and saying, 'Teacher, what having done, life age-during shall I inherit?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said unto him, 'In the law what has been written? how do you read?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he answering said, 'You shall love the Lord your God out of all your heart, and out of all your soul, and out of all your strength, and out of all your understanding, and your neighbour as yourself.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to him, 'Rightly you did answer; this do, and you shall live.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he, willing to declare himself righteous, said unto Jesus, 'And who is my neighbour?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and Jesus having taken up the word, said, 'A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, and having stripped him and inflicted blows, they went away, leavinghim half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>'And by a coincidence a certain priest was going down in that way, and having seen him, he passed over on the opposite side;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and in like manner also, a Levite, having been about the place, having come and seen, passed over on the opposite side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>'But a certain Samaritan, journeying, came along him, and having seen him, he was moved with compassion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and having come near, he bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, and having lifted him up on his own beast, he brought him to an inn, and was careful of him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and on the morrow, going forth, taking out two denaries, he gave to the innkeeper, and said to him, Be careful of him, and whatever you may spend more, I, in my coming again, will give back to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>'Who, then, of these three, seems to you to have become neighbour of him who fell among the robbers?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and he said, 'He who did the kindness with him,' then Jesus said to him, 'Be going on, and you be doing in like manner.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it came to pass, in their going on, that he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman, by name Martha, did receive him into her house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and she had also a sister, called Mary, who also, having seated herself beside the feet of Jesus, was hearing the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and Martha was distracted about much serving, and having stood by him, she said, 'Sir, do you not care that my sister left me alone to serve? say then to her, that she may partake along with me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus answering said to her, 'Martha, Martha, you are anxious and disquieted about many things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but of one thing there is need, and Mary the good part did choose, that shall not be taken away from her.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
