he who is reclining (at meat), or he who is ministering? is it not he who is reclining (at meat)? and I -- I am in your midst as he who is ministering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>'And you -- you are those who have remained with me in my temptations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and I appoint to you, as my Father did appoint to me, a kingdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that you may eat and may drink at my table, in my kingdom, and may sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, 'Simon, Simon, lo, the Adversary did ask you for himself to sift as the wheat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and I besought for you, that your faith may not fail; and you, when you did turn, strengthen your brethren.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said to him, 'Sir, with you I am ready both to prison and to death to go;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and he said, 'I say to you, Peter, a cock shall not crow to-day, before thrice you may disown knowing me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, 'When I sent you without bag, and scrip, and sandals, did you lack anything?' and they said, 'Nothing.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then said he to them, 'But, now, he who is having a bag, let him takeit up, and in like manner also a scrip; and he who is not having, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>for I say to you, that yet this that has been written it is necessary for to be fulfilled in me: And with lawless ones he was reckoned, for also the things concerning me have an end.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they said, 'Sir, lo, here are two swords;' and he said to them, 'It is sufficient.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And having gone forth, he went on, according to custom, to the mount of the Olives, and his disciples also followed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and having come to the place, he said to them, 'Pray you not to enter into temptation.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he was withdrawn from them, as it were a stone's cast, and having fallen on the knees he was praying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, 'Father, if You be counseling to make this cup pass from me --; but, not my will, but Yours be done.' --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there appeared to him a messenger from heaven strengthening him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and having been in agony, he was more earnestly praying, and his sweat became, as it were, great drops of blood falling upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And having risen up from the prayer, having come unto the disciples, he found them sleeping from the sorrow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and he said to them, 'Why do you sleep? having risen, pray that you may not enter into temptation.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he is speaking, lo, a multitude, and he who is called Judas, one of the twelve, was coming before them, and he came near to Jesus to kiss him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and Jesus said to him, 'Judas, with a kiss the Son of Man do you deliver up?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And those about him, having seen what was about to be, said to him, 'Sir, shall we smite with a sword?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And a certain one of them smote the servant of the chief priest, and took off his right ear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and Jesus answering said, 'Suffer you thus far,' and having touched his ear, he healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to those having come upon him -- chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and elders -- 'As upon a robber have you come forth, with swords and sticks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>while daily I was with you in the temple, you did stretch forth no hands against me; but this is your hour and the power of the darkness.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And having taken him, they led and brought him to the house of the chief priest. And Peter was following afar off,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and they having kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and having sat down together, Peter was sitting in the midst of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and a certain maid having seen him sitting at the light, and having earnestly looked at him, she said, 'And this one was with him!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>and he disowned him, saying, 'Woman, I have not known him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a little, another having seen him, said, 'And you are of them!' and Peter said, 'Man, I am not.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And one hour, as it were, having intervened, a certain other was confidently affirming, saying, 'Of a truth this one also was with him, for he is also a Galilean;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and Peter said, 'Man, I have not known what you say;' and presently, while he is speaking, a cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord having turned did look on Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him -- 'Before a cock shall crow, you may disown me thrice;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>and Peter having gone without, wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men who were holding Jesus were mocking him, beating him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>and having blindfolded him, they were striking him on the face, and were questioning him, saying, 'Prophesy who he is who smote you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>and many other things, speaking evilly, they spake in regard to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And when it became day there was gathered together the eldership of the people, chief priests also, and scribes, and they led him up to their own sanhedrin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>saying, 'If you be the Christ, tell us.' And he said to them, 'If I may tell you, you will not believe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>and if I also questionyou, you will not answer me or send me away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>henceforth, there shall be the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power of God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And they all said, 'You, then, are the Son of God?' and he said unto them, 'You sayit, because I am;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>and they said, 'What need yet have we of testimony? for we ourselves did hear it from his mouth.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
