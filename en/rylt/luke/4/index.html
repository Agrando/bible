as great things as we heard done in Capernaum, do also here in your country;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and he said, 'Verily I say to you -- No prophet is accepted in his own country;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and of a truth I say to you, Many widows were in the days of Elijah, in Israel, when the heaven was shut for three years and six months, when great famine came on all the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but -- to Sarepta of Sidon, unto a woman, a widow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and many lepers were in the time of Elisha the prophet, in Israel, and none of them was cleansed, but -- Naaman the Syrian.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all in the synagogue were filled with wrath, hearing these things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and having risen, they put him forth without the city, and brought him unto the brow of the hill on which their city had been built -- to cast him down headlong,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and he, having gone through the midst of them, went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the sabbaths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and they were astonished at his teaching, because his word was with authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And in the synagogue was a man, having a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a great voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>saying, 'Away, what -- to us and to you, Jesus, O Nazarene? you did come to destroy us; I have known you who you are -- the Holy One of God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus did rebuke him, saying, 'Be silenced, and come forth out of him;' and the demon having cast him into the midst, came forth from him, having hurt him nought;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and amazement came upon all, and they were speaking together, with one another, saying, 'What is this word, that with authority and power he does command the unclean spirits, and they come forth?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and there was going forth a fame concerning him to every place of the region round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And having risen out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon, and the mother-in-law of Simon was pressed with a great fever, and they did ask him about her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and having stood over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her, and presently, having risen, she was ministering to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And at the setting of the sun, all, as many as had any ailing with manifold sicknesses, brought them unto him, and he on each one of them his hands having put, did heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And demons also were coming forth from many, crying out and saying -- 'You are the Christ, the Son of God;' and rebuking, he did not suffer them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And day having come, having gone forth, he went on to a desert place, and the multitudes were seeking him, and they came unto him, and were staying him -- not to go on from them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and he said unto them -- 'Also to the other cities it is necessary for me to proclaim good news of the reign of God, because for this I have been sent;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
