you take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>'And he said to him, Out of your mouth I will judge you, evil servant: you knew that I am an austere man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and wherefore did you not give my money to the bank, and I, having come, with interest might have received it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>'And to those standing by he said, Take from him the pound, and give to him having the ten pounds --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(and they said to him, Sir, he has ten pounds) --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for I say to you, that to every one having shall be given, and from him not having, also what he has shall be taken from him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but those my enemies, who did not wish me to reign over them, bring hither and slay before me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And having said these things, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, as he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, unto the mount called of the Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having said, Go away to the village oppositeyou, in which, entering into, you shall find a colt bound, on which no one of men did ever sit, having loosed it, bring it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and if any one does question you, Therefore do you looseit? thus you shall say to him -- The Lord has need of it.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And those sent, having gone away, found according as he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and while they are loosing the colt, its owners said unto them, 'Why loose you the colt?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and they said, 'The Lord has need of it;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and they brought it unto Jesus, and having cast their garments upon the colt, they did set Jesus upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as he is going, they were spreading their garments in the way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and as he is coming near now, at the descent of the mount of the Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God with a great voice for all the mighty works they had seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>saying, 'blessed is he who is coming, a king in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And certain of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, 'Teacher, rebuke your disciples;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and he answering said to them, 'I say to you, that, if these shall be silent, the stones will cry out!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he came near, having seen the city, he wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying -- 'If you did know, even you, at least in this your day, the things for your peace; but now they were hid from your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>'Because days shall come upon you, and your enemies shall cast around you a rampart, and compass you round, and press you on every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and lay you low, and your children within you, and they shall not leave in you a stone upon a stone, because you did not know the time of your inspection.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And having entered into the temple, he began to cast forth those selling in it, and those buying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying to them, 'It has been written, My house is a house of prayer -- but you made it a den of robbers.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes were seeking to destroy him -- also the chiefs of the people --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and they were not finding what they shall do, for all the people were hanging on him, hearing him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
