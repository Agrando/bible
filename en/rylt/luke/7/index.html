I entered into your house; water for my feet you did not give, but this woman with tears did wet my feet, and with the hairs of her head did wipe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>a kiss to me you did not give, but this woman, from whattime I came in, did not cease kissing my feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>with oil my head you did not anoint, but this woman with ointment did anoint my feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>therefore I say to you, her many sins have been forgiven, because she did love much; but to whom little is forgiven, little he does love.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said to her, 'Your sins have been forgiven;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and those reclining with him (at meat) began to say within themselves, 'Who is this, who also does forgive sins?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and he said unto the woman, 'Your faith have saved you, be going on to peace.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
