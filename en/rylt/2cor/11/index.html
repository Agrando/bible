God has known!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and what I do, I also will do, that I may cut off the occasion of those wishing an occasion, that in that which they boast they may be found according as we also;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for those such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and no wonder -- for even the Adversary does transform himself into a messenger of light;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>no great thing, then, if also his ministrants do transform themselves as ministrants of righteousness -- whose end shall be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Again I say, may no one think me to be a fool; and if otherwise, even as a fool receive me, that I also a little may boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That which I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this the confidence of boasting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>since many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for gladly do you bear with the fools -- being wise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for you bear, if any one is bringing you under bondage, if any one does devour, if any one does take away, if any one does exalt himself, if any one on the face does smite you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>in reference to dishonour I speak, how that we were weak, and in whatever any one is bold -- in foolishness I say it -- I also am bold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hebrews are they? I also! Israelites are they? I also! seed of Abraham are they? I also!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>ministrants of Christ are they? -- as beside myself I speak -- I more; in labours more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths many times;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>from Jews five times forty stripes save one I did receive;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice was I shipwrecked, a night and a day in the deep I have passed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>journeyings many times, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from kindred, perils from nations, perils in city, perils in wilderness, perils in sea, perils among false brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>in laboriousness and painfulness, in watchings many times, in hunger and thirst, in fastings many times, in cold and nakedness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>apart from the things without -- the crowding upon me that is daily -- the care of all the assemblies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is infirm, and I am not infirm? who is stumbled, and I am not fired;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>if to boast it behooves me, of the things of my infirmity I will boast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ -- who is blessed to the ages -- has known that I do not lie! --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus the ethnarch of Aretas the king was watching the city of the Damascenes, wishing to seize me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and through a window in a rope basket I was let down, through the wall, and fled out of his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
