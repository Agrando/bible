name="1">1</a>For the law having a shadow of the coming good things -- not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make perfect those coming near,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once been purified?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but in those sacrifices is a remembrance of sins every year,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore, coming into the world, he said, 'Sacrifice and offering You did not will, and a body You did prepare for me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, You did not delight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>then I said, Lo, I come, (in a volume of the book it has been written concerning me,) to do, O God, Your will;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>saying above -- 'Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offering You did not will, nor delight in,' -- which according to the law are offered --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>then he said, 'Lo, I come to do, O God, Your will;' he does take away the first that the second he may establish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and every priest, indeed, has stood daily serving, and the same sacrifices many times offering, that are never able to take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered -- to the end, did sit down on the right hand of God, --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies as his footstool,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for by one offering he has perfected to the end those sanctified;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and testify to us also does the Holy Spirit, for after that He has said before,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>'This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord, giving My laws on their hearts, and upon their minds I will write them,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and 'their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no more;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and where forgiveness of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Having, therefore, brethren, boldness for the entrance into the holy places, in the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>which way he did initiate for us -- new and living, through the vail, that is, his flesh --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and a high priest over the house of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having the body bathed with pure water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope, (for faithful is He who did promise),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a custom of certain is, but exhorting, and so much the more as you see the day coming near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For we -- willfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth -- no more for sins does there remain a sacrifice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery zeal, about to devour the opposers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from mercies, by two or three witnesses, does die,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy who the Son of God did trample on, and the blood of the covenant did count a common thing, in which he was sanctified, and to the Spirit of the grace did despite?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for we have known Him who is saying, 'Vengeance is Mine, I will recompense, says the Lord;' and again, 'The Lord shall judge His people;' --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>fearful is the falling into the hands of a living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And call to your remembrance the former days, in which, having been enlightened, you did endure much conflict of sufferings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made spectacles, and partly having become partners of those so living,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>for also with my bonds you sympathized, and the robbery of your goods with joy you did receive, knowing that you have in yourselves a better substance in the heavens, and an enduring one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>You may not cast away, then, your boldness, which has great recompense of reward,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for of patience you have need, that the will of God having done, you may receive the promise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>for yet a very little, He who is coming will come, and will not tarry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and 'the righteous by faith shall live,' and 'if he may draw back, My soul has no pleasure in him,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but of those believing to a preserving of soul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
