name="1">1</a>It had, indeed, then (even the first tabernacle) ordinances of service, also a worldly sanctuary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>for a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which was both the lamp-stand, and the table, and the bread of the presence -- which is called 'Holy;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and after the second vail a tabernacle that is called 'Holy of holies,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid all round about with gold, in which is the golden pot having the manna, and the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tables of the covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and over it cherubim of the glory, overshadowing the mercy-seat, concerning which we are not now to speak particularly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle, indeed, at all times the priests do go in, performing the services,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and into the second, once in the year, only the chief priest, not apart from blood, which he does offer for himself and the errors of the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the Holy Spirit this evidencing that not yet has been manifested the way of the holy places, the first tabernacle having yet a standing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>which is a simile in regard to the present time, in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are not able, in regard to conscience, to make perfect him who is serving,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>only in victuals, and drinks, and different baptisms, and fleshly ordinances -- till the time of reformation imposed upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Christ being come, chief priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands -- that is, not of this creation --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>neither through blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, did enter in once into the holy places, age-during redemption having obtained;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for if the blood of bulls, and goats, and ashes of an heifer, sprinkling those defiled, does sanctify to the purifying of the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>how much more shall the blood of the Christ (who through the age-during Spirit did offer himself unblemished to God) purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And because of this, of a new covenant he is mediator, that, death having come, for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those called may receive the promise of the age-during inheritance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for where a covenant is, the death of the covenant-victim to come in is necessary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for a covenant over dead victims is stedfast, since it is no force at all when the covenant-victim lives,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>whence not even the first apart from blood has been initiated,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for every command having been spoken, according to law, by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of the calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he both the book itself and all the people did sprinkle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>saying, 'This is the blood of the covenant that God enjoined unto you,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service with blood in like manner he did sprinkle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and with blood almost all things are purified according to the law, and apart from blood-shedding forgiveness does not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It is necessary, therefore, the pattern indeed of the things in the heavens to be purified with these, and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for not into holy places made with hands did the Christ enter -- figures of the true -- but into the heaven itself, now to be manifested in the presence of God for us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>nor that he may many times offer himself, even as the chief priest does enter into the holy places every year with blood of others;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>since it had behoved him many times to suffer from the foundation of the world, but now once, at the full end of the ages, for putting away of sin through his sacrifice, he has been manifested;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and as it is laid up to men once to die, and after this -- judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so also the Christ, once having been offered to bear the sins of many, a second time, apart from a sin-offering, shall appear, to those waiting for him -- to salvation!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
