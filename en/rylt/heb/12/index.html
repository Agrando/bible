shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of the spirits, and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for they, indeed, for a few days, according to what seemed good to them, were chastening, but He for profit, to be partakers of His separation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and all chastening for the present, indeed, does not seem to be of joy, but of sorrow, yet afterward the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those exercised through it -- it does yield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, the hanging-down hands and the loosened knees set you up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and straight paths make for your feet, that that which is lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>peace pursue with all, and the separation, apart from which no one shall see the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up may give trouble, and through this many may be defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>lest any one be a fornicator, or a profane person, as Esau, who in exchange for one morsel of food did sell his birthright,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for you know that also afterwards, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was disapproved of, for a place of reformation he found not, though with tears having sought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For you came not near to the mount touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of sayings, which those having heard did entreat that a word might not be added to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for they were not bearing that which is commanded, 'And if a beast may touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or with an arrow shot through,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and, (so terrible was the sight,) Moses said, 'I am fearful exceedingly, and trembling.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But, you came to Mount Zion, and to a city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of messengers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>to the company and assembly of the first-born in heaven enrolled, and to God the judge of all, and to spirits of righteous men made perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to a mediator of a new covenant -- Jesus, and to blood of sprinkling, speaking better things than that of Abel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See, may you not refuse him who is speaking, for if those did not escape who refused him who upon earth was divinely speaking -- much less we who do turn away from him who speaks from heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>whose voice the earth shook then, and now has he promised, saying, 'Yet once -- I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and this -- 'Yet once' -- does make evident the removal of the things shaken, as of things having been made, that the things not shaken may remain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>therefore, a kingdom that cannot be shaken receiving, may we have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly, with reverence and religious fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for also our God is a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
