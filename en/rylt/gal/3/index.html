on account of the transgressions it was added, till the seed might come to which the promise has been made, having been set in order through messengers in the hand of a mediator --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the mediator is not of one, and God is one --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>the law, then, is against the promises of God? -- let it not be! for if a law was given that was able to make alive, truly by law there would have been the righteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but the Writing did shut up the whole under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ may be given to those believing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And before the coming of the faith, under law we were being kept, shut up to the faith about to be revealed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>so that the law became our child-conductor -- to Christ, that by faith we may be declared righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the faith having come, no more under a child-conductor are we,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for you are all sons of God through the faith in Christ Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for as many as to Christ were baptized did put on Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>there is not here Jew or Greek, there is not here servant nor freeman, there is not here male and female, for all you are one in Christ Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and if you are of Christ then of Abraham you are seed, and according to promise -- heirs.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
