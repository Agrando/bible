for I testify to you, that if possible, your eyes having plucked out, you would have given to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>so that your enemy have I become, being true to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>they are zealous for you -- yet not well, but they wish to shut us out, that for them you may be zealous;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and it is good to be zealously regarded, in what is good, at all times, and not only in my being present with you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>my little children, of whom again I travail in birth, till Christ may be formed in you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and I was wishing to be present with you now, and to change my voice, because I am in doubt about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, you who are willing to be under law, the law do you not hear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for it has been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the maid-servant, and one by the free-woman,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but he who is of the maid-servant, according to flesh has been, and he who is of the free-woman, through the promise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>which things are allegorized, for these are the two covenants: one, indeed, from mount Sinai, to servitude bringing forth, which is Hagar;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and does correspond to the Jerusalem that now is, and is in servitude with her children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and the Jerusalem above is the free-woman, which is mother of us all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for it has been written, 'Rejoice, O barren, who are not bearing; break forth and cry, you who are not travailing, because many are the children of the desolate -- more than of her having the husband.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but as then he who was born according to the flesh did persecute him according to the spirit, so also now;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but what saith the Writing? 'Cast forth the maid-servant and her son, for the son of the maid-servant may not be heir with the son of the free-woman;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>then, brethren, we are not a maid-servant's children, but the free-woman's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
