and those according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>for the mind of the flesh is death, and the mind of the Spirit -- life and peace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>because the mind of the flesh is enmity to God, for to the law of God it does not subject itself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for neither is it able; and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God does dwell in you; and if any one has not the Spirit of Christ -- this one is not His;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and if Christ is in you, the body, indeed, is dead because of sin, and the Spirit is life because of righteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and if the Spirit of Him who did raise up Jesus out of the dead does dwell in you, He who did raise up the Christ out of the dead shall quicken also your dying bodies, through His Spirit dwelling in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So, then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for if according to the flesh you do live, you are about to die; and if, by the Spirit, the deeds of the body you put to death, you shall live;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for you did not receive a spirit of bondage again for fear, but you did receive a spirit of adoption in which we cry, 'Abba -- Father.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit himself does testify with our spirit, that we are children of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and if children, also heirs, heirs, indeed, of God, and heirs together of Christ -- if, indeed, we suffer together, that we may also be glorified together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory about to be revealed in us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for the earnest looking out of the creation does expect the revelation of the sons of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for to vanity was the creation made subject -- not of its will, but because of Him who did subject it -- in hope,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that also the creation itself shall be set free from the servitude of the corruption to the liberty of the glory of the children of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for we have known that all the creation does groan together, and does travail in pain together till now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only so, but also we ourselves, having the first-fruit of the Spirit, we also ourselves in ourselves do groan, adoption expecting -- the redemption of our body;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for in hope we were saved, and hope beheld is not hope; for what any one does behold, why also does he hope for it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and if what we do not behold we hope for, through continuance we expect it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, in like manner also, the Spirit does help our weaknesses; for, what we may pray for, as it behooves us, we have not known, but the Spirit himself does make intercession for us with groanings unutterable,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and He who is searching the hearts has known what is the mind of the Spirit, because according to God he does intercede for saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we have known that to those loving God all things do work together for good, to those who are called according to purpose;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>because whom He did foreknow, He also did fore-appoint, conformed to the image of His Son, that he might be first-born among many brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and whom He did fore-appoint, these also He did call; and whom He did call, these also He declared righteous; and whom He declared righteous, these also He did glorify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What, then, shall we say unto these things? if God is for us, who is against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who indeed His own Son did not spare, but for us all did deliver him up, how shall He not also with him the all things grant to us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who shall lay a charge against the choice ones of God? God is He that is declaring righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>who is he that is condemning? Christ is He that died, yea, rather also, was raised up; who is also on the right hand of God -- who also does intercede for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who shall separate us from the love of the Christ? tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>(according as it has been written -- 'For Your sake we are put to death all the day long, we were reckoned as sheep of slaughter,')</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>but in all these we more than conquer, through him who loved us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>for I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor messengers, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor things about to be, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
