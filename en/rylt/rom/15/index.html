and laud Him, all you peoples;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and again, Isaiah says, 'There shall be the root of Jesse, and he who is rising to rule nations -- upon him shall nations hope;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and the God of the hope shall fill you with all joy and peace in the believing, for your abounding in the hope in power of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I am persuaded, my brethren -- I myself also -- concerning you, that you yourselves also are full of goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, able also one another to admonish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the more boldly I did write to you, brethren, in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me by God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for my being a servant of Jesus Christ to the nations, acting as priest in the good news of God, that the offering up of the nations may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I have, then, a boasting in Christ Jesus, in the things pertaining to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for I will not dare to speak anything of the things that Christ did not work through me, to obedience of nations, by word and deed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in power of signs and wonders, in power of the Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circle as far as Illyricum, have fully preached the good news of the Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and so counting it honour to proclaim good news, not where Christ was named -- that upon another's foundation I might not build --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but according as it has been written, 'To whom it was not told concerning him, they shall see; and they who have not heard, shall understand.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, also, I was hindered many times from coming unto you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and now, no longer having place in these parts, and having a longing to come unto you for many years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>when I may go on to Spain I will come unto you, for I hope in going through, to see you, and by you to be set forward thither, if of you first, in part, I shall be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, now, I go on to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for it pleased Macedonia and Achaia well to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who are in Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for it pleased well, and their debtors they are, for if in their spiritual things the nations did participate, they ought also, in the fleshly things, to minister to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This, then, having finished, and having sealed to them this fruit, I will return through you, to Spain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and I have known that coming unto you -- in the fulness of the blessing of the good news of Christ I shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I call upon you, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in the prayers for me unto God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be delivered from those not believing in Judea, and that my ministration, that is for Jerusalem, may become acceptable to the saints;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>that in joy I may come unto you, through the will of God, and may be refreshed with you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the God of the peace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
