-- not knowing that the goodness of God does lead you to reformation!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But, according to your hardness and impenitent heart, you do treasure up to yourself wrath, in a day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who shall render to each according to his works;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>to those, indeed, who in continuance of a good work, do seek glory, and honour, and incorruptibility -- life age-during;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and to those contentious, and disobedient, indeed, to the truth, and obeying the unrighteousness -- indignation and wrath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>tribulation and distress, upon every soul of man that is working the evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and glory, and honour, and peace, to every one who is working the good, both to Jew first, and to Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For there is no acceptance of faces with God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for as many as without law did sin, without law also shall perish, and as many as did sin in law, through law shall be judged,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for not the hearers of the law are righteous before God, but the doers of the law shall be declared righteous: --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For, when nations that have not a law, by nature may do the things of the law, these not having a law -- to themselves are a law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who do show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also witnessing with them, and between one another the thoughts accusing or else defending,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my good news, through Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Lo, you are named a Jew, and do rest upon the law, and do boast in God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and do know the will, and do approve the distinctions, being instructed out of the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and have confidence that you yourself are a leader of blind ones, a light of those in darkness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>an instructor of foolish ones, a teacher of babes, having the form of the knowledge and of the truth in the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You, then, who are teaching another, yourself do you not teach?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>you who are preaching not to steal, do you steal? you who are saying not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? you who are abhorring the idols, do you rob temples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>you who in the law do boast, through the transgression of the law God do you dishonour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for the name of God because of you is evil spoken of among the nations, according as it has been written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For circumcision, indeed, does profit, if law you may practise, but if a transgressor of law you may be, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If, therefore the uncircumcision the righteousness of the law may keep, shall not his uncircumcision for circumcision be reckoned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the uncircumcision, by nature, fulfilling the law, shall judge you who, through letter and circumcision, are a transgressor of law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he is not a Jew who is so outwardly, neither is circumcision that which is outward in flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but a Jew is he who is so inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart, in spirit, not in letter, of which the praise is not of men, but of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
