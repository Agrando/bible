'Near you is the saying -- in your mouth, and in your heart:' that is, the saying of the faith, that we preach;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that if you may confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and may believe in your heart that God did raise him out of the dead, you shall be saved,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for with the heart does one believe to righteousness, and with the mouth is confession made to salvation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for the Writing says, 'Every one who is believing on him shall not be ashamed,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for there is no difference between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord of all is rich to all those calling upon Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for every one -- whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, he shall be saved.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How then shall they call upon him in whom they did not believe? and how shall they believe on him of whom they did not hear? and how shall they hear apart from one preaching?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and how shall they preach, if they may not be sent? according as it has been written, 'How beautiful the feet of those proclaiming good tidings of peace, of those proclaiming good tidings of the good things!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they were not all obedient to the good tidings, for Isaiah says, 'Lord, who did give credence to our report?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so then the faith is by a report, and the report through a saying of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>but I say, Did they not hear? yes, indeed -- 'to all the earth their voice went forth, and to the ends of the habitable world their sayings.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I say, Did not Israel know? first Moses says, 'I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation; by an unintelligent nation I will anger you,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and Isaiah is very bold, and says, 'I was found by those not seeking Me; I became manifest to those not inquiring after Me;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and unto Israel He says, 'All the day I did stretch out My hands unto a people unbelieving and gainsaying.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
