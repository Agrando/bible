'I left to Myself seven thousand men, who did not bow a knee to Baal.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So then also in the present time a remnant according to the choice of grace there has been;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and if by grace, no more of works, otherwise the grace becomes no more grace; and if of works, it is no more grace, otherwise the work is no more work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? What Israel does seek after, this it did not obtain, and the chosen did obtain, and the rest were hardened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>according as it has been written, 'God gave to them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear,' -- unto this very day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and David says, 'Let their table become for a snare, and for a trap, and for a stumbling-block, and for a recompense to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>let their eyes be darkened -- not to behold, and their back do You always bow down.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say, then, Did they stumble that they might fall? let it not be! but by their fall the salvation is to the nations, to arouse them to jealousy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and if the fall of them is the riches of a world, and the diminution of them the riches of nations, how much more the fulness of them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For to you I speak -- to the nations -- inasmuch as I am indeed an apostle of nations, my ministration I do glorify;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if by any means I shall arouse to jealousy mine own flesh, and shall save some of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for if the casting away of them is a reconciliation of the world, what the reception -- if not life out of the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and if the first-fruit is holy, the lump also; and if the root is holy, the branches also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if certain of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, wast graffed in among them, and a fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree did become --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>do not boast against the branches; and if you do boast, you do not bear the root, but the root you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say, then, 'The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in;' right!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>by unbelief they were broken off, and you have stood by faith; be not high-minded, but be fearing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for if God the natural branches did not spare -- lest perhaps He also shall not spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Lo, then, goodness and severity of God -- upon those indeed who fell, severity; and upon you, goodness, if you may remain in the goodness, otherwise, you also shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And those also, if they may not remain in unbelief, shall be graffed in, for God is able again to graff them in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for if you, out of the olive tree, wild by nature, wast cut out, and, contrary to nature, wast graffed into a good olive tree, how much rather shall they, who are according to nature, be graffed into their own olive tree?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this secret -- that you may not be wise in your own conceits -- that hardness in part to Israel has happened till the fulness of the nations may come in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and so all Israel shall be saved, according as it has been written, 'There shall come forth out of Sion he who is delivering, and he shall turn away impiety from Jacob,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and this to them is the covenant from Me, when I may take away their sins.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>As regards, indeed, the good tidings, they are enemies on your account; and as regards the choice -- beloved on account of the fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for unrepented of are the gifts and the calling of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for as you also once did not believe in God, and now did find kindness by the unbelief of these:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so also these now did not believe, that in your kindness they also may find kindness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for God did shut up together the whole to unbelief, that to the whole He might do kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>O depth of riches, and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable His judgments, and untraceable His ways!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For who did know the mind of the Lord? or who did become His counsellor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>or who did first give to Him, and it shall be given back to him again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>because of Him, and through Him, and to Him are the all things; to Him is the glory -- to the ages.
