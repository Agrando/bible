He who is eating, to the Lord he does eat, for he does give thanks to God; and he who is not eating, to the Lord he does not eat, and does give thanks to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us to himself does live, and none to himself does die;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for both, if we may live, to the Lord we live; if also we may die, to the Lord we die; both then if we may live, also if we may die, we are the Lord's;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for because of this Christ both died and rose again, and lived again, that both of dead and of living he may be Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you, why do you judge your brother? or again, you, why do you set at nought your brother? for we shall all stand at the tribunal of the Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for it has been written, 'I live! says the Lord -- to Me bow shall every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so, then, each of us concerning himself shall give reckoning to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>no longer, therefore, may we judge one another, but this judge you rather, not to put a stumbling-stone before the brother, or an offence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have known, and am persuaded, in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself, except to him who is reckoning anything to be unclean -- to that one it is unclean;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and if through victuals your brother is grieved, no more do you walk according to love; do not with your victuals destroy that one for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for the reign of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for he who in these things is serving the Christ, is acceptable to God and approved of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So, then, the things of peace may we pursue, and the things of building up one another;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for the sake of victuals cast not down the work of God; all things, indeed, are pure, but evil is to the man who is eating through stumbling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Right it is not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything in which your brother does stumble, or is made to fall, or is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You have faith! To yourself have it before God; happy is he who is not judging himself in what he does approve,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and he who is making a difference, if he may eat, has been condemned, because it is not of faith; and all that is not of faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
