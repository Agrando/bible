I adjure you by God, may you not afflict me!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(for he said to him, 'Come forth, spirit unclean, out of the man,')</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he was questioning him, 'Whatis your name?' and he answered, saying, 'Legion is my name, because we are many;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and he was calling on him much, that he may not send them out of the region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there was there, near the mountains, a great herd of swine feeding,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and all the demons did call upon him, saying, 'Send us to the swine, that into them we may enter;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and immediately Jesus gave them leave, and having come forth, the unclean spirits did enter into the swine, and the herd did rush down the steep place to the sea -- and they were about two thousand -- and they were choked in the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And those feeding the swine did flee, and told in the city, and in the fields, and they came forth to see what it is that has been done;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and they come unto Jesus, and see the demoniac, sitting, and clothed, and right-minded -- him having had the legion -- and they were afraid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and those having seen it, declared to them how it had come to pass to the demoniac, and about the swine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they began to call upon him to go away from their borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he having gone into the boat, the demoniac was calling on him that he may be with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Jesus did not suffer him, but said to him, 'Go away to your house, unto your ownfriends, and tell them how great things the Lord did to you, and dealt kindly with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he went away, and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how great things Jesus did to him, and all were wondering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus having passed over in the boat again to the other side, there was gathered a great multitude to him, and he was near the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and lo, there does come one of the chiefs of the synagogue, by name Jairus, and having seen him, he does fall at his feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and he was calling upon him much, saying -- 'My little daughter is at the last extremity -- that having come, you may lay on her your hands, so that she may be saved, and she shall live;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and he went away with him. And there was following him a great multitude, and they were thronging him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and a certain woman, having an issue of blood twelve years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and many things having suffered under many physicians, and having spent all that she had, and having profited nothing, but rather having come to the worse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>having heard about Jesus, having come in the multitude behind, she touched his garment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for she said -- 'If even his garments I may touch, I shall be saved;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and immediately was the fountain of her blood dried up, and she knew in the body that she has been healed of the plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And immediately Jesus having known in himself that out of him power had gone forth, having turned about in the multitude, said, 'Who did touch my garments?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and his disciples said to him, 'You see the multitude thronging you, and you say, 'Who did touch me!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he was looking round to see her who did this,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the woman, having been afraid, and trembling, knowing what was done on her, came, and fell down before him, and told him all the truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and he said to her, 'Daughter, your faith has saved you; go away in peace, and be whole from your plague.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As he is yet speaking, there come from the chief of the synagogue's house, certain, saying -- 'Your daughter did die, why still do you harass the Teacher?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jesus immediately, having heard the word that is spoken, said to the chief of the synagogue, 'Be not afraid, only believe.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he did not suffer any one to follow with him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and he comes to the house of the chief of the synagogue, and sees a tumult, much weeping and wailing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and having gone in he said to them, 'Why do you make a tumult, and weep? the child did not die, but does sleep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and they were laughing at him. And he, having put all forth, does take the father of the child, and the mother, and those with him, and goes in where the child is lying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and, having taken the hand of the child, he said to her, 'Talitha cumi;' which is, being interpreted, 'Damsel (I say to you), arise.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And immediately the damsel arose, and was walking, for she was twelve years old; and they were amazed with a great amazement,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and he charged them much, that no one may know this thing, and he said that there be given to her to eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
