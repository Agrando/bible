may we give, or may we not give?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, 'Why me do you tempt? bring me a denary, that I may see;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and they brought, and he said to them, 'Whoseis this image, and the inscription?' and they said to him, 'Caesar's;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and Jesus answering said to them, 'Give back the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God;' and they did wonder at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Sadducees come unto him, who say there is not a rising again, and they questioned him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>'Teacher, Moses wrote to us, that if any one's brother may die, and may leave a wife, and may leave no children, that his brother may take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>'There were then seven brothers, and the first took a wife, and dying, he left no seed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and the second took her, and died, neither left he seed, and the third in like manner,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the seven took her, and left no seed, last of all died also the woman;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>in the rising again, then, whenever they may rise, of which of them shall she be wife -- for the seven had her as wife?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus answering said to them, 'Do you not because of this go astray, not knowing the Writings, nor the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for when they may rise out of the dead, they neither marry nor are they given in marriage, but are as messengers who are in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>'And concerning the dead, that they rise: have you not read in the Book of Moses (at The Bush), how God spake to him, saying, Iam the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>he is not the God of dead men, but a God of living men; you then go greatly astray.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the scribes having come near, having heard them disputing, knowing that he answered them well, questioned him, 'Which is the first command of all?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and Jesus answered him -- 'The first of all the commandsis, Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and you shall love the Lord your God out of all your heart, and out of your soul, and out of all your understanding, and out of all your strength -- thisis the first command;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the secondis like it, this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself; -- greater than these there is no other command.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the scribe said to him, 'Well, Teacher, in truth you have spoken that there is one God, and there is none other but He;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and to love Him out of all the heart, and out of all the understanding, and out of all the soul, and out of all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as one's self, is more than all the whole burnt-offerings and the sacrifices.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus, having seen him that he answered with understanding, said to him, 'You are not far from the reign of God;' and no one any more did question him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus answering said, teaching in the temple, 'How say the scribes that the Christ is son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my lord, Sit you on My right hand, till I place your enemies -- your footstool;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>therefore David himself said of him Lord, and whence is he his son?' And the great multitude were hearing him gladly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and he was saying to them in his teaching, 'Beware of the scribes, who will in long robes to walk, and love salutations in the market-places,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and first seats in the synagogues, and first couches in suppers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>who are devouring the widows' houses, and for a pretense are making long prayers; these shall receive more abundant judgment.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus having sat down across from the treasury, was beholding how the multitude did put brass into the treasury, and many rich were putting in much,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and having come, a poor widow did put in two mites, which are a farthing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And having called near his disciples, he said to them, 'Verily I say to you, that this poor widow has put in more than all those putting into the treasury;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>for all, out of their abundance, put in, but she, out of her want, all that she had put in -- all her living.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
