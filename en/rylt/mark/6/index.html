And he was going round the villages, in a circle, teaching,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he does call near the twelve, and he began to send them forth two by two, and he was giving them power over the unclean spirits,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and he commanded them that they may take nothing for the way, except a staff only -- no scrip, no bread, no brass in the girdle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but having been shod with sandals, and you may not put on two coats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, 'Whenever you may enter into a house, there remain till you may depart thence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and as many as may not receive you, nor hear you, going out thence, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony to them; verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom or Gomorrah in a day of judgment than for that city.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And having gone forth they were preaching that men might reform,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and many demons they were casting out, and they were anointing with oil many infirm, and they were healing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king Herod heard, (for his name became public,) and he said -- 'John the Baptist out of the dead was raised, and because of this the mighty powers are working in him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Others said -- 'It is Elijah,' and others said -- 'It is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Herod having heard, said -- 'He whom I did behead -- John -- this is he; he was raised out of the dead.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod himself, having sent forth, did lay hold on John, and bound him in the prison, because of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, because he married her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for John said to Herod -- 'It is not lawful to you to have the wife of your brother;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Herodias was having a quarrel with him, and was willing to kill him, and was not able,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for Herod was fearing John, knowing him a man righteous and holy, and was keeping watch over him, and having heard him, was doing many things, and hearing him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And a seasonable day having come, when Herod on his birthday was making a supper to his great men, and to the chiefs of thousands, and to the first men of Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the daughter of that Herodias having come in, and having danced, and having pleased Herod and those reclining (at meat) with him, the king said to the damsel, 'Ask of me whatever you will, and I will give to you,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and he sware to her -- 'Whatever you may ask me, I will give to you -- unto the half of my kingdom.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she, having gone forth, said to her mother, 'What shall I ask for myself?' and she said, 'The head of John the Baptist;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and having come in immediately with haste unto the king, she asked, saying, 'I will that you may give me presently, upon a plate, the head of John the Baptist.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king -- made very sorrowful -- because of the oaths and of those reclining (at meat) with him, would not put her away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and immediately the king having sent a guardsman, did command his head to be brought,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he having gone, beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head upon a plate, and did give it to the damsel, and the damsel did give it to her mother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and having heard, his disciples came and took up his corpse, and laid it in the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the apostles are gathered together unto Jesus, and they told him all, and how many things they did, and how many things they taught,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and he said to them, 'Come you yourselves apart to a desert place, and rest a little,' for those coming and those going were many, and not even to eat had they opportunity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and they went away to a desert place, in the boat, by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the multitudes saw them going away, and many recognized him, and by land from all the cities they ran thither, and went before them, and came together to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and having come forth, Jesus saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion on them, that they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he began to teach many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And now the hour being advanced, his disciples having come near to him, say, -- 'The place is desolate, and the hour is now advanced,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>let them away, that, having gone away to the surrounding fields and villages, they may buy to themselves loaves, for what they may eat they have not.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he answering said to them, 'Give you them to eat,' and they say to him, 'Having gone away, may we buy two hundred denaries' worth of loaves, and give to them to eat?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, 'How many loaves have you? go and see;' and having known, they say, 'Five, and two fishes.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he commanded them to make all recline in companies upon the green grass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and they sat down in squares, by hundreds, and by fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, having looked up to the heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves, and was giving to his disciples, that they may set before them, and the two fishes divided he to all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they did all eat, and were filled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and they took up of broken pieces twelve hand-baskets full, and of the fishes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and those eating of the loaves were about five thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And immediately he constrained his disciples to go into the boat, and to go before to the other side, unto Bethsaida, till he may let the multitude away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and having taken leave of them, he went away to the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And evening having come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone upon the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and he saw them harassed in the rowing, for the wind was against them, and about the fourth watch of the night he does come to them walking on the sea, and wished to pass by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they having seen him walking on the sea, thought it to be an apparition, and cried out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>for they all saw him, and were troubled, and immediately he spake with them, and said to them, 'Take courage, I amhe, be not afraid.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he went up unto them to the boat, and the wind lulled, and greatly out of measure were they amazed in themselves, and were wondering,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>for they understood not concerning the loaves, for their heart has been hard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And having passed over, they came upon the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and they having come forth out of the boat, immediately having recognized him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>having run about through all that region round about, they began upon the couches to carry about those ill, where they were hearing that he is,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and wherever he was going, to villages, or cities, or fields, in the market-places they were laying the infirm, and were calling upon him, that they may touch if it were but the fringe of his garment, and as many as were touching him were saved.</span>
