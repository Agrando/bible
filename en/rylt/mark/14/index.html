this is my body.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having taken the cup, having given thanks, he gave to them, and they drank of it -- all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and he said to them, 'This is my blood of the new covenant, which for many is being poured out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>verily I say to you, that no more may I drink of the produce of the vine till that day when I may drink it new in the reign of God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And having sung an hymn, they went forth to the mount of the Olives,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and Jesus said to them -- 'All you shall be stumbled at me this night, because it has been written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>but after my having risen I will go before you to Galilee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Peter said to him, 'And if all shall be stumbled, yet not I;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus said to him, 'Verily I say to you, that to-day, this night, before a cock shall crow twice, three times you shall deny me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he spake the more vehemently, 'If it may be necessary for me to die with you -- I will in nowise deny you;' and in like manner also said they all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they come to a spot, the name of which is Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, 'Sit you here till I may pray;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and he takes Peter, and James, and John with him, and began to be amazed, and to be very heavy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and he said to them, 'Exceeding sorrowful is my soul -- to death; remain here, and watch.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And having gone forward a little, he fell upon the earth, and was praying, that, if it be possible the hour may pass from him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and he said, 'Abba, Father; all things are possible to You; make this cup pass from me; but, not what I will, but what You.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he comes, and finds them sleeping, and said to Peter, 'Simon, you do sleep! you were not able to watch one hour!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Watch you and pray, that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is forward, but the flesh weak.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And again having gone away, he prayed, the same word saying;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and having returned, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy, and they had not known what they might answer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he comes the third time, and said to them, 'Sleep on now, and rest -- it is over; the hour did come; lo, the Son of Man is delivered up to the hands of the sinful;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>rise, we may go, lo, he who is delivering me up has come near.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately -- while he is yet speaking -- comes near Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude, with swords and sticks, from the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and he who is delivering him up had given a token to them, saying, 'Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is, lay hold on him, and lead him away safely,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and having come, immediately, having gone near him, he said, 'Rabbi, Rabbi,' and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they laid on him their hands, and kept hold on him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and a certain one of those standing by, having drawn the sword, struck the servant of the chief priest, and took off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Jesus answering said to them, 'As against a robber you came out, with swords and sticks, to take me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>daily I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hold on me -- but that the Writings may be fulfilled.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And having left him they all fled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and a certain young man was following him, having put a linen cloth about his naked body, and the young men lay hold on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and he, having left the linen cloth, did flee from them naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they led away Jesus unto the chief priest, and come together to him do all the chief priests, and the elders, and the scribes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and Peter afar off did follow him, to the inside of the hall of the chief priest, and he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself near the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the chief priests and all the sanhedrin were seeking against Jesus testimony -- to put him to death, and they were not finding,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>for many were bearing false testimony against him, and their testimonies were not alike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And certain having risen up, were bearing false testimony against him, saying --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>'We heard him saying -- I will throw down this sanctuary made with hands, and by three days, another made without hands I will build;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>and neither so was their testimony alike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And the chief priest, having risen up in the midst, questioned Jesus, saying, 'You do not answer anything! what do these testify against you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and he was keeping silent, and did not answer anything. Again the chief priest was questioning him, and said to him, 'Are you the Christ -- the Son of the Blessed?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>and Jesus said, 'I am; and you shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power, and coming with the clouds, of the heaven.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the chief priest, having rent his garments, said, 'What need have we yet of witnesses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>You heard the evil speaking, what appears to you?' and they all condemned him to be worthy of death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>and certain began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, 'Prophesy;' and the officers were striking him with their palms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And Peter being in the hall beneath, there does come one of the maids of the chief priest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>and having seen Peter warming himself, having looked on him, she said, 'And you were with Jesus of Nazareth!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>and he denied, saying, 'I have not known him, neither do I understand what you say;' and he went forth without to the porch, and a cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And the maid having seen him again, began to say to those standing near -- 'This is of them;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>and he was again denying. And after a little again, those standing near said to Peter, 'Truly you are of them, for you also are a Galilean, and your speech is alike;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>and he began to anathematize, and to swear -- 'I have not known this man of whom you speak;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>and a second time a cock crew, and Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him -- 'Before a cock crow twice, you may deny me thrice;' and having thought thereon -- he was weeping.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
