Verily I say to you, There may not be left here a stone upon a stone, that shall not be thrown down.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when he is sitting on the mount of the Olives, the disciples came near to him by himself, saying, 'Tell us, when shall these be? And what is the sign of thy presence, and of the full end of the age?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus answering said to them, 'Take heed that no one may lead you astray,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>for many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and they shall lead many astray,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and you shall begin to hear of wars, and reports of wars; see, be not troubled, for it behooves allthese to come to pass, but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>'For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and all theseare the beginning of sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they shall deliver you up to tribulation, and shall kill you, and you shall be hated by all the nations because of my name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and then shall many be stumbled, and they shall deliver up one another, and shall hate one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>'And many false prophets shall arise, and shall lead many astray;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and because of the abounding of the lawlessness, the love of the many shall become cold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but he who did endure to the end, he shall be saved;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and this good news of the reign shall be proclaimed in all the world, for a testimony to all the nations; and then shall the end arrive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>'Whenever, therefore, you may see the abomination of the desolation, that was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (whoever is reading let him observe)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then those in Judea -- let them flee to the mounts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>he on the house-top -- let him not come down to take up any thing out of his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he in the field -- let him not turn back to take his garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>'And woo to those with child, and to those giving suck in those days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and pray you that your flight may not be in winter, nor on a sabbath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for there shall be then great tribulation, such as was not from the beginning of the world till now, no, nor may be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if those days were not shortened, no flesh would have been saved; but because of the chosen, shall those days be shortened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>'Then if any one may say to you, Lo, hereis the Christ!
