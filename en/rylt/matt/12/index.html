That they might accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to them, 'What man shall be of you, who shall have one sheep, and if this may fall on the sabbaths into a ditch, will not lay hold on it and raiseit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How much better, therefore, is a man than a sheep? -- So that it is lawful on the sabbaths to do good.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said he to the man, 'Stretch forth your hand,' and he stretched it forth, and it was restored whole as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Pharisees having gone forth, held a consultation against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jesus having known, withdrew from there, and there followed him great multitudes, and he healed them all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and did charge them that they might not make him manifest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>'Lo, My servant, whom I did choose, My beloved, in whom My soul did delight, I will put My Spirit upon him, and judgment to the nations he shall declare,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>he shall not strive nor cry, nor shall any hear in the broad places his voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>a bruised reed he shall not break, and smoking flax he shall not quench, till he may put forth judgment to victory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and in his name shall nations hope.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then was brought to him a demoniac, blind and dumb, and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, 'Is this the Son of David?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the Pharisees having heard, said, 'This one does not cast out demons, except by Beelzeboul, ruler of the demons.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, 'Every kingdom having been divided against itself is desolated, and no city or house having been divided against itself, does stand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and if the Adversary does cast out the Adversary, against himself he was divided, how then does his kingdom stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>'And if I, by Beelzeboul, do cast out the demons, your sons -- by whom do they cast out?

How are you able to speak good things -- being evil? For out of the abundance of the heart does the mouth speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The good man out of the good treasure of the heart does put forth the good things, and the evil man out of the evil treasure does put forth evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>'And I say to you, that every idle word that men may speak, they shall give for it a reckoning in a day of judgment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>for from your words you shall be declared righteous, and from your words you shall be declared unrighteous.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then answered certain of the scribes and Pharisees, saying, 'Teacher, we will to see a sign from you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he answering said to them, 'A generation, evil and adulterous, does seek a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>for, as Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>'Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, for they reformed at the proclamation of Jonah, and lo, a greater than Jonah here!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>'A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and lo, a greater than Solomon here!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>'And, when the unclean spirit may go forth from the man, it does walk through dry places seeking rest, and does not find;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>then it said, I will turn back to my house from which I came forth; and having come, it findsit unoccupied, swept, and adorned:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>then does it go, and take with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and having gone in they dwell there, and the last of that man does become worse than the first; so shall it be also to this evil generation.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And while he was yet speaking to the multitudes, lo, his mother and brethren had stood without, seeking to speak to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and one said to him, 'Lo, your mother and your brethren do stand without, seeking to speak to you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he answering said to him who spoke to him, 'Who is my mother? And who are my brethren?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And having stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, he said, 'Lo, my mother and my brethren!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For whoever may do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
