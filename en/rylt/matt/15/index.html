For they do not wash their hands when they may eat bread.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he answering said to them, 'Why also do you transgress the command of God because of your tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For God did command, saying, Honour your father and mother; and, He who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die the death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but you say, Whoever may say to father or mother, An offeringis whatever you may be profited by me; --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and he may not honour his father or his mother, and you did set aside the command of God because of your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>'Hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This people does draw near to Me with their mouth, and with the lips it does honour Me, but their heart is far off from Me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and in vain do they worship Me, teaching teachings -- commands of men.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And having called near the multitude, he said to them, 'Hear and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>not that which is coming into the mouth does defile the man, but that which is coming forth from the mouth, this defiles the man.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then his disciples having come near, said to him, 'Have you known that the Pharisees, having heard the word, were stumbled?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he answering said, 'Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant shall be rooted up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>let them alone, guides they are -- blind of blind; and if blind may guide blind, both into a ditch shall fall.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Peter answering said to him, 'Explain to us this simile.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jesus said, 'Are you also yet without understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not understand that all that is going into the mouth does pass into the belly, and into the drain is cast forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the things coming forth from the mouth from the heart do come forth, and these defile the man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, whoredoms, thefts, false witnessings, evil speakings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>these are the things defiling the man; but to eat with unwashen hands does not defile the man.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus having come forth from there, withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and lo, a woman, a Canaanitess, from those borders having come forth, did call to him, saying, 'Deal kindly with me, Sir -- Son of David; my daughter is miserably demonized.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he did not answer her a word; and his disciples having come to him, were asking him, saying -- 'Let her away, because she cries after us;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and he answering said, 'I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having come, she was bowing to him, saying, 'Sir, help me;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and he answering said, 'It is not good to take the children's bread, and to cast to the little dogs.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And she said, 'Yes, sir, for even the little dogs do eat of the crumbs that are falling from their lords' table;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then answering, Jesus said to her, 'O woman, greatis your faith, let it be to you as you will;' and her daughter was healed from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus having passed from there, came near unto the sea of Galilee, and having gone up to the mountain, he was sitting there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and there came to him great multitudes, having with them lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they did cast them at the feet of Jesus, and he healed them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so that the multitudes did wonder, seeing dumb ones speaking, maimed whole, lame walking, and blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus having called near his disciples, said, 'I have compassion upon the multitude, because now three days they continue with me, and they have not what they may eat; and to let them away fasting I will not, lest they faint in the way.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And his disciples say to him, 'From where to us, in a wilderness, so many loaves, as to fill so great a multitude?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said to them, 'How many loaves have you?' And they said, 'Seven, and a few little fishes.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having given thanks, he did break, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they did all eat, and were filled, and they took up what was over of the broken pieces seven baskets full,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and those eating were four thousand men, apart from women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And having let away the multitudes, he went into the boat, and did come to the borders of Magdala.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
