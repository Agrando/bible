He said to him, 'You have said.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And while they were eating, Jesus having taken the bread, and having blessed, did brake, and was giving to the disciples, and said, 'Take, eat, this is my body;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and having taken the cup, and having given thanks, he gave to them, saying, 'Drink you of it -- all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for this is my blood of the new covenant, that for many is being poured out -- to remission of sins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and I say to you, that I may not drink henceforth on this produce of the vine, till that day when I may drink it with you new in the reign of my Father.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And having sung a hymn, they went forth to the mount of the Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>then said Jesus to them, 'All you shall be stumbled at me this night; for it has been written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but, after my having risen, I will go before you to Galilee.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Peter answering said to him, 'Even if all shall be stumbled at you, I will never be stumbled.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him, 'Verily I say to you, that, this night, before cock-crowing, thrice you will deny me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter said to him, 'Even if it may be necessary for me to die with you, I will not deny you;' in like manner also said all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then come with them does Jesus to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, 'Sit you here, till having gone away, I shall pray yonder.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And having taken Peter, and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful, and to be very heavy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>then said he to them, 'Exceedingly sorrowful is my soul -- unto death; abide you here, and watch with me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And having gone forward a little, he fell on his face, praying, and saying, 'My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he comes unto the disciples, and finds them sleeping, and he said to Peter, 'So! You were not able one hour to watch with me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch, and pray, that you may not enter into temptation: the spirit indeed is forward, but the flesh weak.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Again, a second time, having gone away, he prayed, saying, 'My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from me except I drink it, Your will be done;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and having come, he finds them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And having left them, having gone away again, he prayed a third time, saying the same word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>then comes he unto his disciples, and said to them, 'Sleep on henceforth, and rest! Lo, the hour has come near, and the Son of Man is delivered up to the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Rise, let us go; lo, he has come near who is delivering me up.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he is yet speaking, lo, Judas, one of the twelve did come, and with him a great multitude, with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he who did deliver him up did give them a sign, saying, 'Whomsoever I will kiss, it is he: lay hold on him;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and immediately, having come to Jesus, he said, 'Hail, Rabbi,' and kissed him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and Jesus said to him, 'Comrade, for what are you present?' Then having come near, they laid hands on Jesus, and took hold on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And lo, one of those with Jesus, having stretched forth the hand, drew his sword, and having struck the servant of the chief priest, he took off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then said Jesus to him, 'Turn back your sword to its place; for all who did take the sword, by the sword shall perish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>do you think that I am not able now to call upon my Father, and He will place beside me more than twelve legions of messengers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>How then may the Writings be fulfilled, that thus it behooves to happen?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, 'As against a robber you did come forth, with swords and sticks, to take me! Daily with you I was sitting teaching in the temple, and you did not lay hold on me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>but all this has come to pass, that the Writings of the prophets may be fulfilled;' then all the disciples, having left him, fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And those laying hold on Jesus led him away unto Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>and Peter was following him afar off, unto the court of the chief priest, and having gone in within, he was sitting with the officers, to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And the chief priests, and the elders, and all the council, were seeking false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and they did not find; and many false witnesses having come near, they did not find; and at last two false witnesses having come near,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>said, 'This one said, I am able to throw down the sanctuary of God, and after three days to build it.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the chief priest having stood up, said to him, 'Nothing you do answer! What do these witness against you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And Jesus was silent. And the chief priest answering said to him, 'I adjure you, by the living God, that you may say to us, if you are the Christ -- the Son of God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus said to him, 'You have said; nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power, and coming upon the clouds, of the heaven.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the chief priest rent his garments, saying, -- 'He has spoken evil; what need have we yet of witnesses? Lo, now you heard his evil speaking;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>what think you?' And they answering said, 'He is worthy of death.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then did they spit in his face and buffet him, and others did slap,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying, 'Declare to us, O Christ, who he is that struck you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And Peter without was sitting in the court, and there came near to him a certain maid, saying, 'And you wast with Jesus of Galilee!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And he denied before all, saying, 'I have not known what you say.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And he having gone forth to the porch, another female saw him, and said to those there, 'And this one was with Jesus of Nazareth;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>and again did he deny with an oath -- 'I have not known the man.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And after a little those standing near having come, said to Peter, 'Truly you also are of them, for even your speech does make you manifest.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then began he to anathematize, and to swear -- 'I have not known the man;' and immediately did a cock crow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>and Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, he having said to him -- 'Before cock-crowing, thrice you will deny me;' and having gone without, he did weep bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
