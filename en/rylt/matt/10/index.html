James of Zebedee, and John his brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax-gatherer; James of Alpheus, and Lebbeus who was surnamed Thaddeus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who did also deliver him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>These twelve did Jesus send forth, having given command to them, saying, 'To the way of the nations go not away, and into a city of the Samaritans go not in,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and be going rather unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>'And, going on, proclaim saying that, the reign of the heavens has come near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>infirm ones be healing, lepers be cleansing, dead be raising, demons be casting out -- freely you did receive, freely give.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>'Provide not gold, nor silver, nor brass in your girdles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor scrip for the way, nor two coats, nor sandals, nor staff -- for the workman is worthy of his nourishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>'And into whatever city or village you may enter, inquire you who in it is worthy, and there abide, till you may go forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And coming to the house salute it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and if indeed the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it; and if it be not worthy, let your peace turn back to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>'And whoever may not receive you nor hear your words, coming forth from that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>'Lo, I do send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves, be you therefore wise as the serpents, and simple as the doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, take you heed of men, for they will give you up to sanhedrins, and in their synagogues they will scourge you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and before governors and kings you shall be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>'And whenever they may deliver you up, be not anxious how or what you may speak, for it shall be given you in that hour what you shall speak;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for you are not the speakers, but the Spirit of your Father that is speaking in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>'And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and father child, and children shall rise up against parents, and shall put them to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and you shall be hated by all because of my name, but he who has endured to the end, he shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>'And whenever they may persecute you in this city, flee to the other, for verily I say to you, you may not have completed the cities of Israel till the Son of Man may come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>'A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>sufficient to the disciple that he may be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord; if the master of the house they did call Beelzeboul, how much more those of his household?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>'You may not, therefore, fear them, for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed, and hid, that shall not be known;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that which I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light, and that which you hear at the ear, proclaim on the house-tops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>'And be not afraid of those killing the body, and are not able to kill the soul, but fear rather Him who is able both soul and body to destroy in gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>'Are not two sparrows sold for an assar?
