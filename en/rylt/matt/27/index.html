You shall see!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And having cast down the silverlings in the sanctuary, he departed, and having gone away, he did strangle himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the chief priests having taken the silverlings, said, 'It is not lawful to put them to the treasury, seeing it is the price of blood;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and having taken counsel, they bought with them the field of the potter, for the burial of strangers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>therefore was that field called, 'Field of blood,' unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then was fulfilled that spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 'And I took the thirty silverlings, the price of him who has been priced, whom they of the sons of Israel did price,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and gave them for the field of the potter, as the Lord did appoint to me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor did question him, saying, 'Are you the king of the Jews!' And Jesus said to him, 'You say.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in his being accused by the chief priests and the elders, he did not answer any thing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>then said Pilate to him, 'Dost you not hear how many things they witness against you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he did not answer him, not even to one word, so that the governor did wonder greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And at the feast the governor had been accustomed to release one to the multitude, a prisoner, whom they willed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and they had then a noted prisoner, called Barabbas,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>they therefore having been gathered together, Pilate said to them, 'Whom will you I shall release to you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for he had known that because of envy they had delivered him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And as he is sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent unto him, saying, 'Nothing -- to you and to that righteous one, for many things did I suffer to-day in a dream because of him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the chief priests and the elders did persuade the multitudes that they might ask for themselves Barabbas, and might destroy Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and the governor answering said to them, 'Which of the two will you that I shall release to you?' And they said, 'Barabbas.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate said to them, 'What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?' They all say to him, 'Let be crucified!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the governor said, 'Why, what evil did he?' And they were crying out the more, saying, 'Let be crucified.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pilate having seen that it profits nothing, but rather a tumult is made, having taken water, he did wash the hands before the multitude, saying, 'I am innocent from the blood of this righteous one; you -- you shall see;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and all the people answering said, 'His blood is upon us, and upon our children!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then did he release to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him up that he may be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the soldiers of the governor having taken Jesus to the Praetorium, did gather to him all the band;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and having unclothed him, they put around him a crimson cloak,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and having plaited him a crown out of thorns they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand, and having kneeled before him, they were mocking him, saying, 'Hail, the king of the Jews.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And having spit on him, they took the reed, and were smiting on his head;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and when they had mocked him, they took off from him the cloak, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And coming forth, they found a man, a Cyrenian, by name Simon: him they impressed that he might bear his cross;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and having come to a place called Golgotha, that is called Place of a Skull,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>they gave him to drink vinegar mixed with gall, and having tasted, he would not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And having crucified him, they divided his garments, casting a lot, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the prophet, 'They divided my garments to themselves, and over my vesture they cast a lot;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and sitting down, they were watching him there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they put up over his head, his accusation written, 'This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then crucified with him are two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on the left,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and those passing by were speaking evil of him, wagging their heads,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and saying, 'You that are throwing down the sanctuary, and in three days building it, save yourself; if Son you are of God, come down from the cross.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And in like manner also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>'Others he saved; himself he is not able to save! If he be King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>he has trusted on God, let Him now deliver him, if He wish him, because he said -- Son of God I am;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>with the same also the robbers, who were crucified with him, were reproaching him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land unto the ninth hour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a great voice, saying, 'Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?' That is, 'My God, my God, why did You forsake me?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And certain of those standing there having heard, said -- 'Elijah he does call;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and immediately, one of them having run, and having taken a spunge, having filled it with vinegar, and having put it on a reed, was giving him to drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>but the rest said, 'Let alone, let us see if Elijah does come -- about to save him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus having again cried with a great voice, yielded the spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and lo, the vail of the sanctuary was rent in two from top unto bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who have fallen asleep, arose,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and having come forth out of the tombs after his rising, they went into the holy city, and appeared to many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And the centurion, and those with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were exceedingly afraid, saying, 'Truly this was God's Son.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And there were there many women beholding from afar, who did follow Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and of Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And evening having come, there came a rich man, from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was discipled to Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>he having gone near to Pilate, asked for himself the body of Jesus; then Pilate commanded the body to be given back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And having taken the body, Joseph wrapped it in clean linen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and laid it in his new tomb, that he hewed in the rock, and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, he went away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and there were there Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the sepulchre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And on the morrow that is after the preparation, were gathered together the chief priests, and the Pharisees, unto Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>saying, 'Sir, we have remembered that that deceiver said while yet living, After three days I do rise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>command, then, the sepulchre to be made secure till the third day, lest his disciples, having come by night, may steal him away, and may say to the people, He rose from the dead, and the last deceit shall be worse than the first.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And Pilate said to them, 'You have a watch, go away, make secure -- as you have known;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>and they, having gone, did make the sepulchre secure, having sealed the stone, together with the watch.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
