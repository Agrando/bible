For there is a necessity for the stumbling-blocks to come, but woo to that man through whom the stumbling-block does come!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>'And if your hand or your foot does cause you to stumble, cut them off and cast from you; it is good for you to enter into the life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet, to be cast to the fire the age-during.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>'And if your eye does cause you to stumble, pluck it out and cast from you; it is good for you one-eyed to enter into the life, rather than having two eyes to be cast to the gehenna of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>'Beware! -- You may not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you, that their messengers in the heavens do always behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for the Son of Man did come to save the lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>'What think you? If a man may have an hundred sheep, and there may go astray one of them, does he not -- having left the ninety-nine, having gone on the mountains -- seek that which is gone astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if it may come to pass that he does find it, verily I say to you, that he does rejoice over it more than over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>so it is not will in presence of your Father who is in the heavens, that one of these little ones may perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>'And if your brother may sin against you, go and show him his fault between you and him alone, if he may hear you, you did gain your brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and if he may not hear, take with you yet one or two, that by the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>'And if he may not hear them, sayit to the assembly, and if also the assembly he may not hear, let him be to you as the heathen man and the tax-gatherer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>'Verily I say to you, Whatever things you may bind upon the earth shall be having been bound in the heavens, and whatever things you may loose on the earth shall be having been loosed in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>'Again, I say to you, that, if two of you may agree on the earth concerning anything, whatever they may ask -- it shall be done to them from my Father who is in the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for where there are two or three gathered together -- to my name, there am I in the midst of them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter having come near to him, said, 'Sir, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him -- till seven times?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to him, 'I do not say to you till seven times, but till seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>'Because of this was the reign of the heavens likened to a man, a king, who did will to take reckoning with his servants,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and he having begun to take account, there was brought near to him one debtor of a myriad of talents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and he having nothing to pay, his lord did command him to be sold, and his wife, and the children, and all, whatever he had, and payment to be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The servant then, having fallen down, was bowing to him, saying, Sir, have patience with me, and I will pay you all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the lord of that servant having been moved with compassion did release him, and the debt he forgave him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>'And, that servant having come forth, found one of his fellow-servants who was owing him an hundred denaries, and having laid hold, he took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that which you owe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His fellow-servant then, having fallen down at his feet, was calling on him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay you all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and he would not, but having gone away, he cast him into prison, till he might pay that which was owing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>'And his fellow-servants having seen the things that were done, were grieved exceedingly, and having come, showed fully to their lord all the things that were done;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>then having called him, his lord said to him, Evil servant! All that debt I did forgive you, seeing you did call upon me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>did it not behoove also you to have dealt kindly with your fellow-servant, as I also dealt kindly with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>'And having been enraged, his lord delivered him to the inquisitors, till he might pay all that was owing to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>so also my heavenly Father will do to you, if you may not forgive each one his brother from your hearts their trespasses.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
