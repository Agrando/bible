Because you shut up the reign of the heavens before men, for you do not go in, nor those going in do you permit to enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>'Woo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you eat up the houses of the widows, and for a pretence make long prayers, because of this you shall receive more abundant judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>'Woo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you go round the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte, and whenever it may happen -- you make him a son of gehenna twofold more than yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>'Woo to you, blind guides, who are saying, Whoever may swear by the sanctuary, it is nothing, but whoever may swear by the gold of the sanctuary -- is debtor!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fools and blind! For whichis greater, the gold, or the sanctuary that is sanctifying the gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>'And, whoever may swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever may swear by the gift that is upon it -- is debtor!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Fools and blind! For whichis greater, the gift, or the altar that is sanctifying the gift?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>'He therefore who did swear by the altar, does swear by it, and by all things on it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he who did swear by the sanctuary, does swear by it, and by Him who is dwelling in it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and he who did swear by the heaven, does swear by the throne of God, and by Him who is sitting upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>'Woo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you give tithe of the mint, and the dill, and the cumin, and did neglect the weightier things of the Law -- the judgment, and the kindness, and the faith; these it behovedyou to do, and those not to neglect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>'Blind guides! Who are straining out the gnat, and the camel are swallowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>'Woo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you make clean the outside of the cup and the plate, and within they are full of rapine and incontinence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>'Blind Pharisee! Cleanse first the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside of them also may become clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>'Woo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you are like to whitewashed sepulchres, which outwardly indeed do appear beautiful, and within are full of bones of dead men, and of all uncleanness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so also you outwardly indeed do appear to men righteous, and within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>'Woo to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the sepulchres of the prophets, and adorn the tombs of the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So that you testify to yourselves, that you are sons of them who did murder the prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and you -- you fill up the measure of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>'Serpents! Brood of vipers! How may you escape from the judgment of the gehenna?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>'Because of this, lo, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes, and of them you will kill and crucify, and of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and will pursue from city to city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>that on you may come all the righteous blood being poured out on the earth from the blood of Abel the righteous, unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>verily I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>'Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that is killing the prophets, and stoning those sent unto you, how often did I will to gather your children together, as a hen does gather her own chickens under the wings, and you did not will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Lo, left desolate to you is your house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>for I say to you, you may not see me henceforth, till you may say, Blessedis he who is coming in the name of the Lord.'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
