And I took to me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dies, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited on me knew that it was the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I said to them, If you think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the LORD said to me, Cast it to the potter: a goodly price that I was priced at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I cut asunder my other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD said to me, Take to you yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For, see, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that stands still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Woe to the idol shepherd that leaves the flock! the sword shall be on his arm, and on his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
