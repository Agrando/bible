And he went to an high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And God met Balaam: and he said to him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the LORD put a word in Balaam' mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he returned to him, and, see, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD has not defied?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: see, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me?
