And Moses prayed for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Make you a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looks on it, shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it on a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sun rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From there they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From there they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Why it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And at the stream of the brooks that goes down to the dwelling of Ar, and lies on the border of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from there they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spoke to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing you to it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The princes dig the well, the nobles of the people dig it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks toward Jeshimon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let me pass through your land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king' high way, until we be past your borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Woe to you, Moab! you are undone, O people of Chemosh: he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even to Dibon, and we have laid them waste even to Nophah, which reaches to Medeba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thus Israel dwelled in the land of the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelled at Heshbon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
