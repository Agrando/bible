and you shall serve: I have given your priest' office to you as a service of gift: and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given you the charge of my heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, by an ordinance for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This shall be your of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In the most holy place shall you eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is yours; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And whatever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring to the LORD, shall be yours; every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every thing devoted in Israel shall be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Every thing that opens the matrix in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be yours: nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shall you redeem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shall you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy: you shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet smell to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the flesh of them shall be yours, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to you and to your seed with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD spoke to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any part among them: I am your part and your inheritance among the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Neither must the children of Israel from now on come near the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them, When you take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this your heave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the corn of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the wine press.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus you also shall offer an heave offering to the LORD of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel; and you shall give thereof the LORD' heave offering to Aaron the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Out of all your gifts you shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore you shall say to them, When you have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the wine press.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And you shall eat it in every place, you and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall you pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest you die.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
