and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because he has despised the word of the LORD, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks on the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they that found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the LORD said to Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Speak to the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it shall be to you for a fringe, that you may look on it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that you seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to go a whoring:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>That you may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
