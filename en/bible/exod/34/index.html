Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All that opens the matrix is mine; and every firstling among your cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you redeem him not, then shall you break his neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem.

And he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses'face shone: and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
