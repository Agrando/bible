as the LORD had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh' heart is hardened, he refuses to let the people go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Get you to Pharaoh in the morning; see, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river' brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shall you take in your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, till now you would not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus said the LORD, In this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand on the waters of Egypt, on their streams, on their rivers, and on their ponds, and on all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the fish that was in the river died;

as the LORD had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the Egyptians dig round about the river for water to drink;
