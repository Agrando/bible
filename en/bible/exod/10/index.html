And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Pharaoh' servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: know you not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not so: go now you that are men, and serve the LORD; for that you did desire.
