And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come to you, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may recover him of his leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man does send to me to recover a man of his leprosy? why consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have you rent your clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And his servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid you do some great thing, would you not have done it? how much rather then, when he said to you, Wash, and be clean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like to the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing of your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he said, As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray you, be given to your servant two mules'burden of earth? for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In this thing the LORD pardon your servant, that when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD lives, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray you, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them on two of his servants; and they bore them before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, From where come you, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant went no where.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to him, Went not my heart with you, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall stick to you, and to your seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
