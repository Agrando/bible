And Elisha said to him, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day? And he said, Yes, I know it; hold you your peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said to him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day? And he answered, Yes, I know it; hold you your peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Elijah said to him, Tarry, I pray you, here; for the LORD has sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And they two went on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided here and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, You have asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so to you; but if not, it shall not be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted here and thither: and Elisha went over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they said to him, Behold now, there be with your servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up, and cast him on some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, You shall not send.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus said the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or barren land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he went up from there to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you bald head; go up, you bald head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
