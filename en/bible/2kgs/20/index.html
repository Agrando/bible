And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Set your house in order; for you shall die, and not live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the LORD, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I beseech you, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus said the LORD, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will heal you: on the third day you shall go up to the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will add to your days fifteen years; and I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Isaiah said, This sign shall you have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: no, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from from where came they to you? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And of your sons that shall issue from you, which you shall beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which you have spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
