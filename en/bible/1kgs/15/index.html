And his mother' name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa' heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king' house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelled at Damascus, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There is a league between me and you, and between my father and your father: behold, I have sent to you a present of silver and gold; come and break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Benhadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelled in Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
