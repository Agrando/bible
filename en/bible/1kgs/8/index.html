but I chose David to be over my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD said to David my father, Whereas it was in your heart to build an house to my name, you did well that it was in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son that shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house to my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD has performed his word that he spoke, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keep covenant and mercy with your servants that walk before you with all their heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who have kept with your servant David my father that you promised him: you spoke also with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that you promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that your children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as you have walked before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now, O God of Israel, let your word, I pray you, be verified, which you spoke to your servant David my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yet have you respect to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer, which your servant prays before you to day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>That your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said, My name shall be there: that you may listen to the prayer which your servant shall make toward this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And listen you to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear you in heaven your dwelling place: and when you hear, forgive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If any man trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before your altar in this house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then hear you in heaven, and do, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When your people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you, and shall turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray, and make supplication to you in this house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, that you teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there be;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all your people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then hear you in heaven your dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of all the children of men;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>That they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of your people Israel, but comes out of a far country for your name' sake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>(For they shall hear of your great name, and of your strong hand, and of your stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Hear you in heaven your dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calls to you for: that all people of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have built, is called by your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>If your people go out to battle against their enemy, wherever you shall send them, and shall pray to the LORD toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house that I have built for your name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then hear you in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>If they sin against you, (for there is no man that sins not,) and you be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives to the land of the enemy, far or near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land where they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication to you in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And so return to you with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then hear you their prayer and their supplication in heaven your dwelling place, and maintain their cause,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And forgive your people that have sinned against you, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against you, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>For they be your people, and your inheritance, which you brought forth out of Egypt, from the middle of the furnace of iron:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>That your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant, and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen to them in all that they call for to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For you did separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be your inheritance, as you spoke by the hand of Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Blessed be the LORD, that has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>That he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And let these my words, with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
