And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray you, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray you, a morsel of bread in your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she said, As the LORD your God lives, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Elijah said to her, Fear not; go and do as you have said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it to me, and after make for you and for your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For thus said the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sends rain on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, O you man of God? are you come to me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to her, Give me your son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he stayed, and laid him on his own bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, have you also brought evil on the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray you, let this child' soul come into him again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother: and Elijah said, See, your son lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
