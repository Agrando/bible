And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the king answered and said to the man of God, Entreat now the face of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God sought the LORD, and the king' hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the man of God said to the king, If you will give me half your house, I will not go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that you came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there dwelled an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken to the king, them they told also to their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their father said to them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him, Are you the man of God that came from Judah? And he said, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, I may not return with you, nor go in with you: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, You shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that you came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to him, I am a prophet also as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with you into your house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet that brought him back:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he cried to the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus said the LORD, For as much as you have disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and have not kept the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to you, Eat no bread, and drink no water; your carcass shall not come to the sepulcher of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient to the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God, and laid it on the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulcher wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
