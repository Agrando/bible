So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred three score and six talents of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Beside that he had of the merchants, and of the traffic of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all king Solomon' drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king' merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
