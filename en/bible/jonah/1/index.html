But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, What mean you, O sleeper? arise, call on your God, if so be that God will think on us, that we perish not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is on us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said they to him, Tell us, we pray you, for whose cause this evil is on us; What is your occupation? and from where come you? what is your country? and of what people are you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which has made the sea and the dry land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him. Why have you done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said they to him, What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea worked, and was tempestuous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea worked, and was tempestuous against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Why they cried to the LORD, and said, We beseech you, O LORD, we beseech you, let us not perish for this man' life, and lay not on us innocent blood: for you, O LORD, have done as it pleased you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the LORD, and made vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
