Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Was then that which is good made death to me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If then I do that which I would not, I consent to the law that it is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
