When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As for me, this is my covenant with them, said the LORD; My spirit that is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed' seed, said the LORD, from now on and for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
