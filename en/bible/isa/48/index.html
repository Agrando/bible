I have showed you new things from this time, even hidden things, and you did not know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when you heard them not; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yes, you heard not; yes, you knew not; yes, from that time that your ear was not opened: for I knew that you would deal very treacherously, and were called a transgressor from the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For my name' sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you, that I cut you not off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For my own sake, even for my own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Listen to me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spanned the heavens: when I call to them, they stand up together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All you, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them has declared these things? The LORD has loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come you near to me, hear you this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus said the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD your God which teaches you to profit, which leads you by the way that you should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O that you had listened to my commandments! then had your peace been as a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of your bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go you forth of Babylon, flee you from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare you, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say you, The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no peace, said the LORD, to the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
