As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it comes from the desert, from a terrible land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous dealer deals treacherously, and the spoiler spoils. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold on me, as the pangs of a woman that travails: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure has he turned into fear to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, you princes, and anoint the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus has the LORD said to me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he sees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he listened diligently with much heed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, behold, here comes a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen.  And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he has broken to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The burden of Dumah. He calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The watchman said, The morning comes, and also the night: if you will inquire, inquire you: return, come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The burden on Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall you lodge, O you traveling companies of Dedanim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For thus has the LORD said to me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel has spoken it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
