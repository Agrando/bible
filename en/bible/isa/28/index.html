and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For precept must be on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To whom he said, This is the rest with which you may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the word of the LORD was to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Why hear the word of the LORD, you scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because you have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing whip shall pass through, it shall not come to us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing whip shall pass through, then you shall be trodden down by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From the time that it goes forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore be you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined on the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Give you ear, and hear my voice; listen, and hear my speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Does the plowman plow all day to sow? does he open and break the clods of his ground?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When he has made plain the face thereof, does he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rye in their place?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For his God does instruct him to discretion, and does teach him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about on the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This also comes forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
