for you, and for your servant, and for your maid, and for your hired servant, and for your stranger that sojournes with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And for your cattle, and for the beast that are in your land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall number seven sabbaths of years to you, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to you forty and nine years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then shall you cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee to you; and you shall return every man to his possession, and you shall return every man to his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be to you: you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of your vine undressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is the jubilee; it shall be holy to you: you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the year of this jubilee you shall return every man to his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if you sell ought to your neighbor, or buy ought of your neighbor' hand, you shall not oppress one another:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy of your neighbor, and according to the number of years of the fruits he shall sell to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>According to the multitude of years you shall increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years you shall diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits does he sell to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You shall not therefore oppress one another; but you shall fear your God: for I am the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why you shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and you shall dwell in the land in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the land shall yield her fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if you shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in you shall eat of the old store.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for you are strangers and sojourners with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If your brother be waxen poor, and has sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the remainder to the man to whom he sold it;

for it is their perpetual possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if your brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with you; then you shall relieve him: yes, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Take you no usury of him, or increase: but fear your God; that your brother may live with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>You shall not give him your money on usury, nor lend him your victuals for increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you;

but shall fear your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Both your slaves, and your bondmaids, which you shall have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall you buy slaves and bondmaids.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall you buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your slaves for ever: but over your brothers the children of Israel, you shall not rule one over another with rigor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by you, and your brother that dwells by him wax poor, and sell himself to the stranger or sojourner by you, or to the stock of the stranger' family:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brothers may redeem him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Either his uncle, or his uncle' son, may redeem him, or any that is near of kin to him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>If there be yet many years behind, according to them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, and according to his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigor over him in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, both he, and his children with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
