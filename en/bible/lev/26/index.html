and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if you shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that you will not do all my commandments, but that you break my covenant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I also will do this to you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will set my face against you, and you shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and you shall flee when none pursues you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if you will not yet for all this listen to me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if you walk contrary to me, and will not listen to me; I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if you will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then will I also walk contrary to you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will bring a sword on you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when you are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if you will not for all this listen to me, but walk contrary to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then I will walk contrary to you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And you shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall you eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the smell of your sweet odors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies'land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As long as it lies desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when you dwelled on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And on them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they shall fall one on another, as it were before a sword, when none pursues: and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And you shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies'lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And that I also have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lies desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
