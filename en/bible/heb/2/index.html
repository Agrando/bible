For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him.  But now we see not yet all things put under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Saying, I will declare your name to my brothers, in the middle of the church will I sing praise to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For truly he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
