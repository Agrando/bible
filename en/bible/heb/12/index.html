who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to children, My son, despise not you the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For whom the Lord loves he chastens, and whips every son whom he receives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chastens not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if you be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are you bastards, and not sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they truly for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them which are exercised thereby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For you are not come to the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See that you refuse not him that speaks. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaks from heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this word, Yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Why we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For our God is a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
