He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Why the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if you be Christ', then are you Abraham' seed, and heirs according to the promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
