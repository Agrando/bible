For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And why slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother' righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Marvel not, my brothers, if the world hate you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers. He that loves not his brother stays in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But whoever has this world' good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him.  And hereby we know that he stays in us, by the Spirit which he has given us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
