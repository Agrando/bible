Yet you say, Wherein have you loved us? Was not Esau Jacob' brother? said the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Whereas Edom said, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus said the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD has indignation for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And your eyes shall see, and you shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear? said the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, that despise my name. And you say, Wherein have we despised your name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You offer polluted bread on my altar; and you say, Wherein have we polluted you? In that you say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now to your governor; will he be pleased with you, or accept your person? said the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious to us: this has been by your means: will he regard your persons? said the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nothing? neither do you kindle fire on my altar for nothing. I have no pleasure in you, said the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, said the LORD of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But you have profaned it, in that you say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and you have snuffed at it, said the LORD of hosts; and you brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus you brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But cursed be the deceiver, which has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, said the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
