She said to them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said to her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you?  She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have borne him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned herself, and said to him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he had so said, he showed to them his hands and his side.  Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive you the Holy Ghost:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whose soever sins you remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins you retain, they are retained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the LORD.  But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the middle, and said, Peace be to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then said he to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Thomas answered and said to him, My LORD and my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
