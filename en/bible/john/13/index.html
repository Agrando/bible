Jesus answered him, If I wash you not, you have no part with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said to him, He that is washed needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and you are clean, but not all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, You are not all clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said to them, Know you what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You call me Master and Lord: and you say well; for so I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another' feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, you may believe that I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now there was leaning on Jesus'bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He then lying on Jesus'breast said to him, Lord, who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, That you do, do quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where go you? Jesus answered him, Where I go, you can not follow me now; but you shall follow me afterwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for my sake? Truly, truly, I say to you, The cock shall not crow, till you have denied me thrice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
