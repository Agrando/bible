Are you Elias? And he said, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said they to him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What say you of yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom you know not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe' lace I am not worthy to unloose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And looking on Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, What seek you? They said to him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwell you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He said to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelled, and stayed with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter' brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and said to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip finds Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael said to him, From where know you me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, believe you? you shall see greater things than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
