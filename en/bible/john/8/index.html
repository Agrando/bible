But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the oldest, even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those your accusers? has no man condemned you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn you: go, and sin no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Pharisees therefore said to him, You bore record of yourself; your record is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know from where I came, and where I go; but you cannot tell from where I come, and where I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me bears witness of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said they to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you should have known my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These words spoke Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Jesus again to them, I go my way, and you shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I go, you cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he said, Where I go, you cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I said therefore to you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said they to him, Who are you? And Jesus said to them, Even the same that I said to you from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he that sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As he spoke these words, many believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered him, We be Abraham' seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Whoever commits sin is the servant of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the servant stays not in the house for ever: but the Son stays ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that you are Abraham' seed; but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham' children, you would do the works of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do you not understand my speech? even because you cannot hear my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And because I tell you the truth, you believe me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Which of you convinces me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He that is of God hears God' words: you therefore hear them not, because you are not of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honor my Father, and you do dishonor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeks and judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that you have a devil.  Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Are you greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom make you yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered, If I honor myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that honors me; of whom you say, that he is your God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Yet you have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like to you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then said the Jews to him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the middle of them, and so passed by.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
