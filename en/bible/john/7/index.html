If you do these things, show yourself to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For neither did his brothers believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Go you up to this feast: I go not up yet to this feast: for my time is not yet full come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When he had said these words to them, he stayed still in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when his brothers were gone up, then went he also up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceives the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Jews marveled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law?  Why go you about to kill me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The people answered and said, You have a devil: who goes about to kill you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses therefore gave to you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and you on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are you angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But, see, he speaks boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>However, we know this man from where he is: but when Christ comes, no man knows from where he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I know him: for I am from him, and he has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ comes, will he do more miracles than these which this man has done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What manner of saying is this that he said, You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>(But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Has not the scripture said, That Christ comes of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there was a division among the people because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have you not brought him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are you also deceived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this people who knows not the law are cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Does our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he does?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee?  Search, and look: for out of Galilee rises no prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And every man went to his own house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
