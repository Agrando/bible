And they went out both of them into the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jonathan said to David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not to you, and show it you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do you evil, then I will show it you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you shall not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD has cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David' enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and you shall be missed, because your seat will be empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when you have stayed three days, then you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, take them; then come you: for there is peace to you, and no hurt; as the LORD lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I say thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond you; go your way: for the LORD has sent you away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as touching the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between you and me for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul' side, and David' place was empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David' place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why comes not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said, Let me go, I pray you; for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my brothers. Therefore he comes not to the king' table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Saul' anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own confusion, and to the confusion of your mother' nakedness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the ground, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Why now send and fetch him to me, for he shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why shall he be slain? what has he done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said to his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan' lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jonathan gave his artillery to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, for as much as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
