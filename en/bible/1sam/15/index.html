So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until you come to Shur, that is over against Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatted calves, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then came the word of the LORD to Samuel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It repents me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried to the LORD all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed be you of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Samuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what the LORD has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel said, When you were little in your own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed you king over Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the LORD sent you on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but did fly on the spoil, and did evil in the sight of the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel said, Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and your words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now therefore, I pray you, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you: for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold on the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samuel said to him, The LORD has rent the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, that is better than you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray you, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then said Samuel, Bring you here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
