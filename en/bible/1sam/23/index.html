And the LORD said to David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David' men said to him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he declined to go forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David stayed in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jonathan Saul' son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David stayed in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king' hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul said, Blessed be you of the LORD; for you have compassion on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there: for it is told me that he deals very subtly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come you again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David; why he came down into a rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste you, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Why Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And David went up from there, and dwelled in strong holds at Engedi.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
