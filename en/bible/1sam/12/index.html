And they answered, He is witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Samuel said to the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when they forgot the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you dwelled safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now therefore behold the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have desired! and, behold, the LORD has set a king over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both you and also the king that reigns over you continue following the LORD your God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call to the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Samuel called to the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, that we die not: for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: you have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And turn you not aside: for then should you go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name' sake: because it has pleased the LORD to make you his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he has done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
