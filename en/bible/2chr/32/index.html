And the people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus said Sennacherib king of Assyria, Where on do you trust, that you abide in the siege in Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Has not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, You shall worship before one altar, and burn incense on it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Know you not what I and my fathers have done to all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And his servants spoke yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews'speech to the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thereafter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed to the LORD: and he spoke to him, and he gave him a sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done to him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath on him, and on Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not on them in the days of Hezekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>However, in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the most chief of the sepulchers of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
