neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the LORD said to David my father, For as much as it was in your heart to build an house for my name, you did well in that it was in your heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Notwithstanding you shall not build the house; but your son which shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house for my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The LORD therefore has performed his word that he has spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the middle of the court: and on it he stood, and kneeled down on his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like you in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keep covenant, and show mercy to your servants, that walk before you with all their hearts:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You which have kept with your servant David my father that which you have promised him; and spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; yet so that your children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as you have walked before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you have spoken to your servant David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house which I have built!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Have respect therefore to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to listen to the cry and the prayer which your servant prays before you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That your eyes may be open on this house day and night, on the place whereof you have said that you would put your name there; to listen to the prayer which your servant prays toward this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Listen therefore to the supplications of your servant, and of your people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear you from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him to make him swear, and the oath come before your altar in this house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then hear you from heaven, and do, and judge your servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way on his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And if your people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against you; and shall return and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then hear you from the heavens, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you do afflict them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then hear you from heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you have taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatever sore or whatever sickness there be:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all your people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then hear you from heaven your dwelling place, and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you only know the hearts of the children of men:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>That they may fear you, to walk in your ways, so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of your people Israel, but is come from a far country for your great name' sake, and your mighty hand, and your stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then hear you from the heavens, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calls to you for; that all people of the earth may know your name, and fear you, as does your people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If your people go out to war against their enemies by the way that you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then hear you from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If they sin against you, (for there is no man which sins not,) and you be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives to a land far off or near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yet if they bethink themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn and pray to you in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, and toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then hear you from the heavens, even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people which have sinned against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now, my God, let, I beseech you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into your resting place, you, and the ark of your strength: let your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints rejoice in goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>O LORD God, turn not away the face of your anointed: remember the mercies of David your servant.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
