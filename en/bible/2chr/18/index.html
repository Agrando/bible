And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as you are, and my people as your people; and we will be with you in the war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray you, at the word of the LORD to day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king' hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good to me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus said the LORD, With these you shall push Syria until they be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let your word therefore, I pray you, be like one of their', and speak you good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Micaiah said, As the LORD lives, even what my God said, that will I speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he was come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go you up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good to me, but evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said to him, With which?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, You shall entice him, and you shall also prevail: go out, and do even so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets, and the LORD has spoken evil against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the king of Israel said, Take you Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king' son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And say, Thus said the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Micaiah said, If you certainly return in peace, then has not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Listen, all you people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and I will go to the battle; but put you on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight you not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn your hand, that you may carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the battle increased that day: however, the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
