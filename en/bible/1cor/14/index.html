I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what you say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brothers, be not children in understanding: however, in malice be you children, but in understanding be men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Why tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serves not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If any thing be revealed to another that sits by, let the first hold his peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also said the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What? came the word of God out from you? or came it to you only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Why, brothers, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Let all things be done decently and in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
