Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said he to me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall come to pass, that every thing that lives, which moves, wherever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live where the river comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand on it from Engedi even to Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the miry places thereof and the marshes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And by the river on the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus said the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby you shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers: and this land shall fall to you for inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the east side you shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border to the east sea. And this is the east side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamath.
