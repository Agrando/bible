Will you hunt the souls of my people, and will you save the souls alive that come to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And will you pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Why thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pillows, with which you there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that you hunt to make them fly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and you shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore you shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and you shall know that I am the LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
