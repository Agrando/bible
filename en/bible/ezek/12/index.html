they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore, you son of man, prepare you stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and you shall remove from your place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then shall you bring forth your stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and you shall go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Dig you through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In their sight shall you bear it on your shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: you shall cover your face, that you see not the ground: for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I dig through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bore it on my shoulder in their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And in the morning came the word of the LORD to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, What do you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Say you to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done to them: they shall remove and go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the prince that is among them shall bear on his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My net also will I spread on him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen where they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and with carefulness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And say to the people of the land, Thus said the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and you shall know that I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Son of man, what is that proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Tell them therefore, Thus said the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say to them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, said the Lord GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he sees is for many days to come, and he prophesies of the times that are far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, said the Lord GOD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
