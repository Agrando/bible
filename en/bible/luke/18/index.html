Nevertheless when the Son of man comes, shall he find faith on the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spoke this parable to certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they brought to him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus called them to him, and said, Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said to him, Why call you me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now when Jesus heard these things, he said to him, Yet lack you one thing: sell all that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle' eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter said, See, we have left all, and followed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to them, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God' sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he took to him the twelve, and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they shall whip him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass, that as he was come near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passes by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he cried, saying, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, You son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought to him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Saying, What will you that I shall do to you? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight: your faith has saved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
