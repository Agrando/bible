Fear not therefore: you are of more value than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also I say to you, Whoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But he that denies me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that blasphemes against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they bring you to the synagogues, and to magistrates, and powers, take you no thought how or what thing you shall answer, or what you shall say:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you ought to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And one of the company said to him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man' life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But God said to him, You fool, this night your soul shall be required of you: then whose shall those things be, which you have provided?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So is he that lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat; neither for the body, what you shall put on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them: how much more are you better than the fowls?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If you then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take you thought for the rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And seek not you what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, neither be you of doubtful mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knows that you have need of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But rather seek you the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father' good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sell that you have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that fails not, where no thief approaches, neither moth corrupts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And you yourselves like to men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he comes shall find watching: truly I say to you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And this know, that if the manager of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Be you therefore ready also: for the Son of man comes at an hour when you think not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Peter said to him, Lord, speak you this parable to us, or even to all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Of a truth I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all that he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delays his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looks not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that servant, which knew his lord' will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For to whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Suppose you that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, No; but rather division:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For from now on there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he said also to the people, When you see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway you say, There comes a shower; and so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when you see the south wind blow, you say, There will be heat; and it comes to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>You hypocrites, you can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that you do not discern this time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Yes, and why even of yourselves judge you not what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>When you go with your adversary to the magistrate, as you are in the way, give diligence that you may be delivered from him; lest he hale you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer cast you into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>I tell you, you shall not depart there, till you have paid the very last mite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
