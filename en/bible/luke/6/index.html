And he arose and stood forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Jesus to them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And looking round about on them all, he said to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when it was day, he called to him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Blessed are you that hunger now: for you shall be filled. Blessed are you that weep now: for you shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blessed are you, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice you in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But woe to you that are rich! for you have received your consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you that are full! for you shall hunger. Woe to you that laugh now! for you shall mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Woe to you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I say to you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which spitefully use you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And to him that smites you on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that takes away your cloak forbid not to take your coat also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to every man that asks of you; and of him that takes away your goods ask them not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as you would that men should do to you, do you also to them likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For if you love them which love you, what thank have you? for sinners also love those that love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if you do good to them which do good to you, what thank have you?  for sinners also do even the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what thank have you? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love you your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be you therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Judge not, and you shall not be judged: condemn not, and you shall not be condemned: forgive, and you shall be forgiven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you mete with it shall be measured to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he spoke a parable to them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And why behold you the mote that is in your brother' eye, but perceive not the beam that is in your own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Either how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in your eye, when you yourself behold not the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of your own eye, and then shall you see clearly to pull out the mote that is in your brother' eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For a good tree brings not forth corrupt fruit; neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And why call you me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Whoever comes to me, and hears my sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He is like a man which built an house, and dig deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently on that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded on a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house on the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
