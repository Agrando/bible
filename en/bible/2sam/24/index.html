And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lies in the middle of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David' heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.  And David said to the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech you, O LORD, take away the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David' seer, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Go and say to David, Thus said the LORD, I offer you three things; choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? or will you flee three months before your enemies, while they pursue you? or that there be three days'pestilence in your land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, See, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let your hand, I pray you, be against me, and against my father' house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, raise an altar to the LORD in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant?  And David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these things did Araunah, as a king, give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, The LORD your God accept you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy it of you at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God of that which does cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
