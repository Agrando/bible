And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom' sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jonadab said to him, Lay you down on your bed, and make yourself sick: and when your father comes to see you, say to him, I pray you, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said to the king, I pray you, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon' house, and dress him meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon' house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of your hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come lie with me, my sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not you this folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I, where shall I cause my shame to go? and as for you, you shall be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>However, he would not listen to her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she said to him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me. But he would not listen to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he called his servant that ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she had a garment of divers colors on her: for with such robes were the king' daughters that were virgins appareled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but hold now your peace, my sister: he is your brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom' house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep shearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king' sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, your servant has sheep shearers; let the king, I beseech you, and his servants go with your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable to you. And he pressed him: however, he would not go, but blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray you, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king' sons go with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now when Amnon' heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded.  Then all the king' sons arose, and every man got him up on his mule, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king' sons, and there is not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David' brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king' sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king' sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king' sons come: as your servant said, so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king' sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the soul of king David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
