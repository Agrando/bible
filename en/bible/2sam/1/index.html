And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David said to him, How went the matter? I pray you, tell me.  And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David said to the young man that told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance on mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned on his spear; and, see, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said to me, Who are you? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to me again, Stand, I pray you, on me, and slay me: for anguish is come on me, because my life is yet whole in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I stood on him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said to the young man that told him, From where are you? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David said to him, How were you not afraid to stretch forth your hand to destroy the LORD' anointed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him. And he smote him that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain the LORD' anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places: how are the mighty fallen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, on you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold on your apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How are the mighty fallen in the middle of the battle! O Jonathan, you were slain in your high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant have you been to me: your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
