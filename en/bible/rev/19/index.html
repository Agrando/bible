And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he was clothed with a clothing dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the armies which were in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he has on his clothing and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the middle of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>That you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that worked miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat on the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
