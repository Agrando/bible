To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.

And he laid his right hand on me, saying to me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am he that lives, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for ever more, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
