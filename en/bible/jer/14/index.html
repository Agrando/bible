yet you, O LORD, are in the middle of us, and we are called by your name; leave us not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus said the LORD to this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD does not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said the LORD to me, Pray not for this people for their good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say to them, You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the LORD said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke to them: they prophesy to you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore thus said the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore you shall say this word to them; Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword!  and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine!  yes, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Have you utterly rejected Judah? has your soul loathed Zion? why have you smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not abhor us, for your name' sake, do not disgrace the throne of your glory: remember, break not your covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? are not you he, O LORD our God?  therefore we will wait on you: for you have made all these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
