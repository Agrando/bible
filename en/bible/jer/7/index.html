Behold, even I have seen it, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now, because you have done all these works, said the LORD, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you heard not; and I called you, but you answered not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore will I do to this house, which is called by my name, wherein you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, even the whole seed of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>See you not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do they provoke me to anger? said the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out on this place, on man, and on beast, and on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people: and walk you in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But they listened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day I have even sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yet they listened not to me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore you shall speak all these words to them; but they will not listen to you: you shall also call to them; but they will not answer you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But you shall say to them, This is a nation that obeys not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receives correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Cut off your hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, said the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
