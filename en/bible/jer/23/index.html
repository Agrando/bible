who has marked his word, and heard it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously on the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days you shall consider it perfectly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Am I a God at hand, said the LORD, and not a God afar off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? said the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yes, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The prophet that has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is not my word like as a fire? said the LORD; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, said the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, I am against the prophets, said the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, said the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? you shall then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, said the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus shall you say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What has the LORD answered? and, What has the LORD spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the burden of the LORD shall you mention no more: for every man' word shall be his burden; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus shall you say to the prophet, What has the LORD answered you? and, What has the LORD spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But since you say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus said the LORD; Because you say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent to you, saying, You shall not say, The burden of the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
