But he listened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Why the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, you shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, What have I offended against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where are now your prophets which prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore hear now, I pray you, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray you, be accepted before you; that you cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers'street, until all the bread in the city were spent.  Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
