But Jesus answers again, and said to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus looking on them said, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter began to say to him, See, we have left all, and have followed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus answered and said, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel',</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he shall receive an hundred times now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid.  And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they shall mock him, and shall whip him, and shall spit on him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Master, we would that you should do for us whatever we shall desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said to them, What would you that I should do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on your right hand, and the other on your left hand, in your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Jesus said to them, You know not what you ask: can you drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized with shall you be baptized:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not my to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But Jesus called them to him, and said to them, You know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But so shall it not be among you: but whoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whoever of you will be the most chief, shall be servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, You son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calls you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, What will you that I should do to you? The blind man said to him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
