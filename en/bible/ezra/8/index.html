but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So we fasted and sought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I even weighed to their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams;

and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they delivered the king' commissions to the king' lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
