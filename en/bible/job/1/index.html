Thus did Job continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said to Satan, From where come you? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and eschews evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have not you made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has on every side? you have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your power; only on himself put not forth your hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother' house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Sabeans fell on them, and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell on the camels, and have carried them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother' house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And said, Naked came I out of my mother' womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
