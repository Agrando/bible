or with speeches with which he can do no good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yes, you cast off fear, and restrain prayer before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For your mouth utters your iniquity, and you choose the tongue of the crafty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Your own mouth comdemns you, and not I: yes, your own lips testify against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Are you the first man that was born? or were you made before the hills?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Have you heard the secret of God? and do you restrain wisdom to yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What know you, that we know not? what understand you, which is not in us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>With us are both the gray headed and very aged men, much elder than your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Are the consolations of God small with you? is there any secret thing with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why does your heart carry you away? and what do your eyes wink at,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>That you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, he puts no trust in his saints; yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinks iniquity like water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will show you, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>To whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The wicked man travails with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He believes not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He wanders abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he stretches out his hand against God, and strengthens himself against the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He runs on him, even on his neck, on the thick bosses of his bucklers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because he covers his face with his fatness, and makes bulges of fat on his flanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he dwells in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabits, which are ready to become heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepares deceit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
