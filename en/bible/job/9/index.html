who will say to him, What do you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had listened to my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he breaks me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He will not suffer me to take my breath, but fills me with bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If I speak of strength, see, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If I justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroys the perfect and the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If the whip slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covers the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hastens to the prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you will not hold me innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If I be wicked, why then labor I in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Yet shall you plunge me in the ditch, and my own clothes shall abhor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Neither is there any judge between us, that might lay his hand on us both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
