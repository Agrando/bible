And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel stayed in Kadesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray you, through your land into my place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So now the LORD God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Will not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now are you any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>While Israel dwelled in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did you not recover them within that time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>However, the king of the children of Ammon listened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the Spirit of the LORD came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then it shall be, that whatever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD', and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he smote them from Aroer, even till you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low, and you are one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And she said to him, My father, if you have opened your mouth to the LORD, do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth; for as much as the LORD has taken vengeance for you of your enemies, even of the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down on the mountains, and mourn my virginity, I and my fellows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
