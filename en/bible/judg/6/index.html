And he said, I will tarry until you come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD said to him, Peace be to you; fear not: you shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take your father' young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the grove that is by it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which you shall cut down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said to him: and so it was, because he feared his father' household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered on the altar that was built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die: because he has cast down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the grove that was by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will you plead for Baal? will you save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one has cast down his altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he has thrown down his altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry on all the earth beside, then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Gideon said to God, Let not your anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray you, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And God did so that night: for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
