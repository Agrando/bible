is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase your army, and come out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he sent messengers to Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now therefore up by night, you and the people that is with you, and lie in wait in the field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and set on the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Gaal spoke again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then said Zebul to him, Where is now your mouth, with which you said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that you have despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even to the entering of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Abimelech dwelled at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran on all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Abimelech got him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said to the people that were with him, What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire on them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and got them up to the top of the tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and went hard to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone on Abimelech' head, and all to broke his skull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, Draw your sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brothers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render on their heads: and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
