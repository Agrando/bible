And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the LORD said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for you there: and it shall be, that of whom I say to you, This shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whomsoever I say to you, This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he brought down the people to the water: and the LORD said to Gideon, Every one that laps of the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him shall you set by himself; likewise every one that bows down on his knees to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the LORD said to Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand: and let all the other people go every man to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Arise, get you down to the host; for I have delivered it into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if you fear to go down, go you with Phurah your servant down to the host:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall your hands be strengthened to go down to the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, see, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand has God delivered Midian, and all the host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD has delivered into your hand the host of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man' hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came to the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow with: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man' sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, to Tabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb on the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
