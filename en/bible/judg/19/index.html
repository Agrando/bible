And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel' father, said to him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day grows to an end, lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that you may go home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray you, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his master said to him, We will not turn aside here into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them when they were by Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Where go you? and from where come you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from there am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receives me to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid, and for the young man which is with your servants: there is no want of any thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the old man said, Peace be with you; howsoever let all your wants lie on me; only lodge not in the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he brought him into his house, and gave provender to the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into your house, that we may know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my brothers, no, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do with them what seems good to you: but to this man do not so vile a thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the men would not listen to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man' house where her lord was, till it was light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were on the threshold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered.  Then the man took her up on an ass, and the man rose up, and got him to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
