but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the middle of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the same cause also do you joy, and rejoice with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly to you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ'.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that you had heard that he had been sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For indeed he was sick near to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow on sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
