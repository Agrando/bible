Why the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, No; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said to him, What said my Lord to his servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the captain of the LORD' host said to Joshua, Loose your shoe from off your foot; for the place where on you stand is holy. And Joshua did so.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
