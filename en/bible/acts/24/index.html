when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: why he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix'room: and Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
