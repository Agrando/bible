And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seems to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached to them Jesus, and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they took him, and brought him to Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof you speak, is?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you bring certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Paul stood in the middle of Mars'hill, and said, You men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him declare I to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Neither is worshipped with men' hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life, and breath, and all things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For as much then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold, or silver, or stone, graven by are and man' device.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear you again of this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Paul departed from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>However, certain men joined to him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
