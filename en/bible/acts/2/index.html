and they shall prophesy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall come to pass, that whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the middle of you, as you yourselves also know:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David speaks concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have made known to me the ways of life; you shall make me full of joy with your countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Men and brothers, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He seeing this before spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus has God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he said himself, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Until I make your foes your footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brothers, what shall we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added to them about three thousand souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they continued steadfastly in the apostles'doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And fear came on every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
