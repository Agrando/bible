Moreover these six brothers accompanied me, and we entered into the man' house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who shall tell you words, whereby you and all your house shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For as much then as God gave them the like gift as he did to us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now they which were scattered abroad on the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but to the Jews only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then tidings of these things came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would hold to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers which dwelled in Judaea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
