And she constrained us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which show to us the way of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.  And he came out the same hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace to the rulers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had laid many stripes on them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises to God: and the prisoners heard them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one' bands were loosed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm: for we are all here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the sergeants told these words to the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they came and sought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brothers, they comforted them, and departed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
