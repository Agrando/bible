And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How much then is a man better than a sheep? Why it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said he to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from there: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And charged them that they should not make him known:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit on him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment to victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or else how can one enter into a strong man' house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Why I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things?  for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A good man out of the good treasure of the heart brings forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I say to you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale' belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he said, I will return into my house from where I came out; and when he is come, he finds it empty, swept, and garnished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then goes he, and takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also to this wicked generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then one said to him, Behold, your mother and your brothers stand without, desiring to speak with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother?  and who are my brothers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brothers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For whoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
