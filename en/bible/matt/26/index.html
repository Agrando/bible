And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where will you that we prepare for you to eat the passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master said, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as they did eat, he said, Truly I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say to him, Lord, is it I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he answered and said, He that dips his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of man goes as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I?  He said to him, You have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink you all of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I say to you, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father' kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then said Jesus to them, All you shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Peter answered and said to him, Though all men shall be offended because of you, yet will I never be offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, That this night, before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter said to him, Though I should die with you, yet will I not deny you. Likewise also said all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then comes Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, Sit you here, while I go and pray yonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then said he to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death: tarry you here, and watch with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he comes to the disciples, and finds them asleep, and said to Peter, What, could you not watch with me one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, your will be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then comes he to his disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that does betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he yet spoke, see, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And immediately he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest', and smote off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then said Jesus to him, Put up again your sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Think you that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are you come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and you laid no hold on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Peter followed him afar off to the high priest' palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But found none: yes, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the high priest arose, and said to him, Answer you nothing? what is it which these witness against you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What think you? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Saying, Prophesy to us, you Christ, Who is he that smote you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what you say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And after a while came to him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them; for your speech denudes you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said to him, Before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
