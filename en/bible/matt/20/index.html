And they went their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why stand you here all the day idle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say to him, Because no man has hired us. He said to them, Go you also into the vineyard; and whatever is right, that shall you receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last to the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they had received it, they murmured against the manager of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Saying, These last have worked but one hour, and you have made them equal to us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do you no wrong: did not you agree with me for a penny?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take that your is, and go your way: I will give to this last, even as to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own? Is your eye evil, because I am good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to whip, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to her, What will you? She said to him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on your right hand, and the other on the left, in your kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, You shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not my to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus called them to him, and said, You know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But it shall not be so among you: but whoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, you son of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, you son of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will you that I shall do to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
