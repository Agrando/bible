And Jesus said to them, Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all things, whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you these things? and who gave you this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The baptism of John, from where was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why did you not then believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But what think you? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Whether of them two did the will of his father? They say to him, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and you, when you had seen it, repented not afterward, that you might believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dig a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went into a far country:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, that they might receive the fruits of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the farmers took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did to them likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But last of all he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But when the farmers saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When the lord therefore of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They say to him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard to other farmers, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord' doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Therefore say I to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
