for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for you neither go in yourselves, neither suffer you them that are entering to go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows'houses, and for a pretense make long prayer: therefore you shall receive the greater damnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, Whoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Whoever therefore shall swear by the altar, swears by it, and by all things thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And whoever shall swear by the temple, swears by it, and by him that dwells therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he that shall swear by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him that sits thereon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like to white washed sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men' bones, and of all uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Why you be witnesses to yourselves, that you are the children of them which killed the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Fill you up then the measure of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You serpents, you generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of hell?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Why, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall you whip in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Truly I say to you, All these things shall come on this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the prophets, and stone them which are sent to you, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Behold, your house is left to you desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For I say to you, You shall not see me from now on, till you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
