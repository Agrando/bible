Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father, and I will come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury your father, according as he made you swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the house of Joseph, and his brothers, and his father' house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: why the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his sons did to him according as he commanded them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burial plot of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when Joseph' brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, Your father did command before he died, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So shall you say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray you now, the trespass of your brothers, and their sin; for they did to you evil: and now, we pray you, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And his brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be your servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Joseph said to them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But as for you, you thought evil against me; but God meant it to good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now therefore fear you not: I will nourish you, and your little ones.  And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joseph dwelled in Egypt, he, and his father' house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joseph saw Ephraim' children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up on Joseph' knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Joseph said to his brothers, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
