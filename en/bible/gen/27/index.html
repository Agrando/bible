And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless you before the LORD before my death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Go now to the flock, and fetch me from there two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for your father, such as he loves:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, and that he may bless you before his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse on me, and not a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And his mother said to him, On me be your curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her oldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who are you, my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your first born; I have done according as you bade me: arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD your God brought it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray you, that I may feel you, my son, whether you be my very son Esau or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob' voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau' hands: so he blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said, Are you my very son Esau? And he said, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son' venison, that my soul may bless you. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you: be lord over your brothers, and let your mother' sons bow down to you: cursed be every one that curses you, and blessed be he that blesses you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son' venison, that your soul may bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your son, your firstborn Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? yes, and he shall be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said, Your brother came with subtlety, and has taken away your blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to you, my son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Esau said to his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, your dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And by your sword shall you live, and shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shall have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, your brother Esau, as touching you, does comfort himself, purposing to kill you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee you to Laban my brother to Haran;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And tarry with him a few days, until your brother' fury turn away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Until your brother' anger turn away from you, and he forget that which you have done to him: then I will send, and fetch you from there: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
