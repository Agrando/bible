Then said the king' servants that ministered to him, There is nothing done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king' house, to speak to the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king' servants said to him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let the royal apparel be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and the crown royal which is set on his head:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king' most noble princes, that they may array the man with whom the king delights to honor, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sits at the king' gate: let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Mordecai came again to the king' gate. But Haman hurried to his house mourning, and having his head covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife to him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom you have begun to fall, you shall not prevail against him, but shall surely fall before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And while they were yet talking with him, came the king' chamberlains, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
