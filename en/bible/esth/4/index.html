Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king' chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend on her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Hatach went forth to Mordecai to the street of the city, which was before the king' gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king' treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him for her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Again Esther spoke to Hatach, and gave him commandment to Mordecai;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All the king' servants, and the people of the king' provinces, do know, that whoever, whether man or women, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they told to Mordecai Esther' words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with yourself that you shall escape in the king' house, more than all the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if you altogether hold your peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but you and your father' house shall be destroyed: and who knows whether you are come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast you for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in to the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
