So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the scepter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then said the king to her, What will you, queen Esther? and what is your request? it shall be even given you to the half of the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Esther answered, If it seem good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther has said.
