Behold, he winnows barley to night in the threshing floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your raiment on you, and get you down to the floor: but make not yourself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she said to her, All that you say to me I will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And she went down to the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Blessed be you of the LORD, my daughter: for you have showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you followed not young men, whether poor or rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to you all that you require: for all the city of my people does know that you are a virtuous woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And now it is true that I am your near kinsman: however, there is a kinsman nearer than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman' part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as the LORD lives: lie down until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Also he said, Bring the veil that you have on you, and hold it.  And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who are you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty to your mother in law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
