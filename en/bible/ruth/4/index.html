And he turned aside, and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you down here. And they sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, sells a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech':</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I thought to advertise you, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside you; and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance: redeem you my right to yourself; for I cannot redeem it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor: and this was a testimony in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for you. So he drew off his shoe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech', and all that was Chilion' and Mahlon', of the hand of Naomi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And let your house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give you of this young woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which has not left you this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he shall be to you a restorer of your life, and a nourisher of your old age: for your daughter in law, which loves you, which is better to you than seven sons, has born him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
