And I set a great assembly against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brothers the Jews, which were sold to the heathen; and will you even sell your brothers? or shall they be sold to us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also I said, It is not good that you do: ought you not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I likewise, and my brothers, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that you exact of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as you say. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performes not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable to the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants bore rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither to the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came to us from among the heathen that are about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy on this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Think on me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
