how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD has destroyed them to this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came into this place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the middle of all Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore shall you keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where you go to possess it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And that you may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed, a land that flows with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from from where you came out, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the land, where you go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water of the rain of heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A land which the LORD your God cares for: the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it shall come to pass, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and your oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will send grass in your fields for your cattle, that you may eat and be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And then the LORD' wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest you perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD gives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign on your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you shall teach them your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to join to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Every place where on the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the uttermost sea shall your coast be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as he has said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A blessing, if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And a curse, if you will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which you have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it shall come to pass, when the LORD your God has brought you in to the land where you go to possess it, that you shall put the blessing on mount Gerizim, and the curse on mount Ebal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goes down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the desert over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God gives you, and you shall possess it, and dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
