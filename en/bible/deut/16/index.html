seven days shall you eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And there shall be no leavened bread seen with you in all your coast seven days;
