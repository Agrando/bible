and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You shall not do so to the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But to the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even to his habitation shall you seek, and thither you shall come:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And thither you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, wherein the LORD your God has blessed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For you are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God gives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when you go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, and when he gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to the LORD:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates;
